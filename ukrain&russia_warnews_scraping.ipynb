       "[{'Title': 'Putin’s confidence upstages Zelenskyy as Ukraine faces uncertain 2024',\n",
       "  'Date': '21 Dec 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Russia’s Putin unveils a record war chest as Ukraine’s Zelenskyy struggles to keep his alliance together. Russia’s Vladimir Putin has committed to spending a post-Cold War record $157bn fighting Ukraine and securing Russia next year – a 70 percent increase on this year’s defence budget. But Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy has failed to secure $61.4bn from the US and $76.6bn from the European Union, among his staunchest allies, riven by internal disagreements over spending. During lengthy press conferences over the past several days about the wartime issues facing them both, the confidence exuded by Russia’s president clearly outshone the mere faith expressed by Ukraine’s. A Ukrainian summer counteroffensive that petered out without significant territorial gains has divided allied generals, as Russian forces have in recent weeks crept forward on the eastern front, putting Ukraine back on the defensive. “Practically, along the entire line of contact, our armed forces are, shall we say, modestly improving their position. Virtually all are in an active stage of action,” said Putin in his annual, end-of-year press conference at the International Trade Centre in Moscow on December 14, departing from his traditionally reserved assessment of the front. Three days later, he told a meeting of his United Russia Party: “Russia will either be a sovereign, self-sufficient power, or it will not be at all,” returning to his pre-war rhetoric of “denazifying” and “demilitarising” Ukraine – code for installing a puppet regime in Kyiv and rendering Ukraine a defenceless buffer zone between Russia and NATO. On December 19, by contrast, Zelenskyy fielded embarrassing questions on why congressional Republicans in Washington and a Russophilic Hungary in the EU have stymied the political process of military aid approval. “I am confident that the United States will not let us down and that what we have agreed upon with the United States will be fully implemented,” he said. “As for the [EU’s] 50 billion euros, I’m confident that a decision will be made in the very near future when they convene. It has been arranged in a way that … there are other mechanisms in place to ensure that Ukraine receives these 50 billion.” The EU is proposing to commit 50 billion euros in financial aid to Ukraine over the next four years, as well as a separate 20 billion in military aid next year – a total of $76.6bn. Putin’s determination was put into perspective in a report by the newspaper Bild on December 14, in which an unnamed Russian source described plans to overrun the remaining areas of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions and to capture much of Kharkiv by the end of 2024. If successful in the latter, it would roll back enormous Ukrainian counteroffensive gains in September last year. The source described second-stage plans to take large parts of the Zaporizhia and Dnipropetrovsk regions and to advance as far as Kharkiv city by the end of 2025 and 2026. Far from the presidents’ decorous press conferences, a war now largely eclipsed in the media is being savagely fought with staggering loss of life. Ukrainian marines who have taken part in operations across the Dnipro river in Kherson told the New York Times they amounted to a “suicide mission”. They described high casualty rates and shelling so intense from Russian positions that they had been unable to recover the bodies of their comrades from the shallows of the Left Bank for two months. Nor have they been able to ferry the wounded back to base camps across the river. “There are no positions. There is no such thing as an observation post or position,” said one soldier. “It is impossible to gain a foothold there. It’s impossible to move equipment there … It’s not even a fight for survival,” he said. “It’s a suicide mission.” Ukraine’s general staff said they would withhold comment until a later date. Ukraine is believed to have succeeded in placing a small force of 200 to 300 soldiers on the Left Bank over the past two months. “These difficulties are to be expected for what is an economy-of-force operation with limited positions,” said the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. The Ukrainian vanguard could be setting conditions for a more secure bridgehead and a launch of operations across the Dnipro, the ISW said. Suppressing Russian artillery on the left bank would enable civilians who fled the Ukraine-controlled right bank of the Dnipro to return. Russia, too, is suffering huge losses on this front. On December 15, British defence intelligence reported “exceptionally heavy losses” among the newly formed Russian 104th Air Assault Division, during its inaugural operation in Kherson. The unit was sent to dislodge the Ukrainian bridgehead after marines failed to do so for two months. Two days later, Ukraine’s armed forces said 1,250 Russian soldiers had been “liquidated” in 24 hours, a staggering number compared with normal casualty rates. With them, 25 armoured personnel carriers and 19 tanks had reportedly been destroyed. Ukrainian authorities did not specify where these highly attritional battles had taken place, but the general staff said Russian assaults continued against Kupiansk, Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Marinka – all on the eastern front – and Novopokrovka and Robotyne on the southern front. Ukraine’s head of ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Russia had lost 8,000 troops on the eastern front alone in the first half of December. For Ukraine, there are shafts of light amid the gloom of a counteroffensive that did not deliver the expected results. Ukraine has defended itself from a Russian drone onslaught devastatingly well. On December 13, it was reported that Ukrainian air defences had downed all 10 Iranian Shahed drones and 10 guided missiles of unspecified types that targeted Kyiv. The following day, they shot down 41 of 42 drones launched into Ukraine as well as all 14 drones and both missiles launched the day after that. On December 16, Ukraine shot down 30 out of 31 drones, all 20 Shahed drones launched on December 17, and 18 out of 19 drones launched on December 20. That represents a 98 percent kill rate for the week. Russia targeted Ukrainian energy and water infrastructure last winter, in a bid to break popular will to support the war. Last week, Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignat said Russia now had enough drones to attack Ukraine every day from various directions – something Russia has practically been doing for much of the autumn. Even if it receives all the $138bn it hopes for in military aid next year, Ukraine faces serious munitions and manpower concerns. Zelenskyy said his military chiefs have proposed lowering the mobilisation age from 27 to 25 to put up to half a million more people in uniform next year, suggesting high attrition to the roughly million-strong force Ukraine had at the beginning of the invasion. Putin, by contrast, said he had 617,000 troops across the front, some 200,000 more than Ukrainian military intelligence had estimated in September. There are also problems with ammunition. Ukrainian Brigadier General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, who leads the forces spearheading the front’s most important counteroffensive, at Robotyne in Zaporizhia, told Reuters that Ukraine was scaling back some operations because of shortages of ammunition “across the entire front line”. “The volumes that we have today are not sufficient for us today … We’re replanning tasks that we had set for ourselves and making them smaller because we need to provide for them,” he said, without providing details.

       " {'Title': 'Roman Abramovich loses legal attempt to overturn EU sanctions',\n",
       "  'Date': '20 Dec 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The EU\\xa0imposed punishment on the oligarch\\xa0in 2022 as part of measures targeting Russia and Putin’s close allies. Russian billionaire Roman\\xa0Abramovich\\xa0has lost a legal challenge aimed at overturning European Union sanctions imposed on him in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich had filed a lawsuit at the EU’s general court against the European Union Council, which imposed punitive sanctions on the 57-year-old in 2022 as part of measures targeting Russia and President Vladimir Putin’s close allies after Russia invaded Ukraine. The court in Brussels rejected the challenge and also dismissed his claims for compensation, noting his role in the Russian steel company Evraz and the fact that steel provided a major source of revenue to the Russian government. “The General Court dismisses the action brought by Mr Abramovich, thereby upholding the restrictive measures taken against him,” it said in its ruling on Wednesday. “The [European] Council did not in fact err in its assessment by deciding to include, then maintain, Mr Abramovich’s name on the lists at issue, in the light of his role in the Evraz group and, in particular, its parent company,” it added, referring to the sanctions lists. Abramovich, who also holds Israeli citizenship and is a former owner of Premier League football club Chelsea, became one of the world’s most powerful businessmen after the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. Forbes estimates his net worth at $9.2bn. In a statement issued on his behalf, Abramovich said he was disappointed by the ruling, which he can appeal. He said the court had not considered some of the arguments used by the EU Council, including the proposition that\\xa0Abramovich\\xa0had benefitted from the Russian government – which he said was a false suggestion. “Mr Abramovich does not have the ability to influence the decision-making of any government, including Russia, and has in no way benefited from the [Ukraine] war,” the statement said. “The court’s decision to maintain the sanctions against Mr\\xa0Abramovich\\xa0was based purely on the court defining Mr\\xa0Abramovich\\xa0as a ‘Russian businessman’ which under today’s very broad EU regulations is sufficient to remain sanctioned, even if you are just a passive shareholder in a business sector with no connection to the war.” The businessman has also been punished in the United Kingdom and had his assets frozen in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich was forced to sell Chelsea after being sanctioned by the British government for what it called his enabling of Putin’s “brutal and barbaric invasion” of Ukraine. The sale of the Premier League club for 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2bn) — then the highest price ever paid for a sports team — was completed by a consortium fronted by Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly. It marked the end of the trophy-filled, 19-year tenure of Abramovich. The EU has imposed\\xa012 rounds of sanctions on Russia since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine almost two years ago. The measures have targeted the energy sector, banks, companies and markets, and made more than 1,000 Russian officials subject to asset freezes and travel bans.

       " {'Title': 'Sanctions on Russian oil have failed. Were they ever meant to succeed?',\n",
       "  'Date': '20 Dec 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Western sanctions imposed a year ago have hardly dented Russia’s ability to wage war. Last December, the European Union banned imports of Russian crude oil in a bid to starve the Russian war machine into submission over its invasion of Ukraine. A year later, the ban appears to have been a failure. The Kyiv School of Economics (KSE), which monitors Russian oil sales, estimates that Moscow will make $178bn from oil sales this year, rising to a potential $200bn next year. These amounts are lower than the record $218 bn Russia earned in oil revenues during the first year of the war, when Europe was still buying about half its oil exports, but they show that Russia has replaced that lost revenue remarkably quickly. “Russia now has to ship its oil over much larger distances. You basically have only China and India left, so it reduces competition and reduces prices,” said Jan Stockbruegger, a researcher with the Ocean Infrastructure Research Group at the University of Copenhagen. But not by much. The KSE says Russia’s benchmark Urals crude traded at $84 a barrel in October, not too far below the $90.78 average price commanded by Brent crude in the same month. Anticipating this, the EU, along with the G7, last year placed a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian oil sold to third parties. This was an ambitious and unprecedented bid by the EU to enforce its will beyond its borders when most Russian oil was still being shipped by Western-owned and Western-insured tankers. But Russian entities have since bought much of the ageing portion of the fleet from Western companies at prices attractively higher than scrap metal, cobbling together a shadow fleet outside Western control. A shadow tanker is “usually a tanker that does not have Western or G7 involvement, in terms of ownership, insurance, finance or any other services”, Stockbruegger told Al Jazeera. “It’s basically a sanction-proof tanker.” Western protection-and-indemnity-insured tankers dropped two-thirds of their trade in Russian crude between April and October, trading places with a shadow fleet that tripled that trade to 2.6 million barrels a day over the same period. The KSE estimates there are at least 187 shadow tankers carrying Russian crude and refined petroleum products. Ukraine’s Western allies could still reduce Russia’s oil revenue by a quarter if they did more to enforce the embargo and price cap, and by more than half if they lowered the price cap to $50 a barrel, says the KSE. But Moscow is banking that they will not. On November 27, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed off on a 70 percent increase in defence and security spending for next year, to $157.5bn. The entire Russian budget of $412bn is itself 13 percent higher than last year, based on higher expected earnings from oil. Economist Maria Demertzis, a senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels, told Al Jazeera a price cap was always going to be difficult to enforce. “How do you prevent a country in the Gulf [from] buying and selling energy to third countries? It’s very difficult to monitor,” she said. Political will was an added obstacle. “At the beginning of the invasion, 50 percent of the world in population terms either sided with Russia or were neutral,” Demertzis said. “This was an indication that countries were not prepared to cut their economic ties to Russia, and therefore any help that the [EU or] G7 would need to try to enforce sanctions just wasn’t there,” she told Al Jazeera. There are signs that the EU and the G7 are getting more serious about enforcing the price cap. In October, Washington may have single-handedly shaved $3 off the price of Russian crude by sanctioning two tankers for using US-based services – the price cap’s first enforcement. Last month, Washington slapped sanctions on three more Liberian-flagged tankers after discovering they regularly shipped Sokol crude from Russia’s far east to Indian Oil Corp. The EU reportedly floated measures last month to allow Denmark to inspect and block Russian oil tankers travelling through the Danish straits – a chokepoint that ships leaving Russian Baltic ports must pass to reach the Atlantic. Stockbruegger believes such gestures will remain token, however. “The simple reality is we need Russian oil on the market,” he told Al Jazeera. “If it is cut out, oil prices globally will rise and inflation will skyrocket. [Joe] Biden will not win the [2024] election if the price of gasoline in the US rises significantly. So the sanctions are set up to ensure Russian oil reaches global markets,” he said. Figures from the Institute of International Finance (IIF) last month show that China, India and Turkey have massively increased Russian crude imports during the Ukraine war, and could be transshipping crude or refined products to Western markets. The use of go-betweens has been documented elsewhere in sanctions evasion. Robin Brooks, the IIF chief economist, also demonstrated that German carmakers had increased their exports of vehicles and spare parts 55-fold to Kyrgyzstan, sevenfold to Kazakhstan and fourfold to Armenia over two years. “This export surge started after Russia invaded Ukraine, so it’s obvious this stuff is going to Moscow. This has to stop,” Brooks wrote on X, formerly Twitter. There is one way in which Moscow’s sales to Europe are genuinely falling, and irreversibly. In the first 10 months of this year, wind and solar power generated a record 28 percent of Europe’s electricity, a six-point increase on last year’s performance, according to Ember, a London-based think tank. They have long overtaken natural gas and coal in electricity generation, for which consumption fell by 15 percent and 30 percent, respectively, this year. “It remains profoundly cheaper to produce electricity by solar or wind [power] rather than fossil fuels or nuclear [power]. That is why they are taking market share,” Beatrice Petrovich, a senior energy and climate analyst at Ember, told Al Jazeera. This is good news for a continent that paid between $1 trillion and $2 trillion more for its energy imports during the first year of the Ukraine war than it did in 2021. “Europe is better prepared than last winter,” Petrovich said. “This is the best insurance policy against price hikes and volatility.” It is also good news for Europe’s goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent in 2030, relative to 1990. But it does not cut Russia’s revenue. “If India and China don’t see the argument that we are trying to make … this is very worrying,” said Demertzis. “The centre of gravity now has gone east, and if they feel one way about things, they have the power to pursue it.” “We always talk about how we support Ukraine in terms of how many weapons we give them and how much ammunition,” said Stockbruegger. “But we never talk about it in terms of how much we are enforcing these sanctions.

       "  'Text': 'US Senate debate on new aid will run into the new year, despite Kyiv push for urgency. The United States Senate will not vote on an aid package for Ukraine this year, the chamber leaders have said. Democratic and Republican negotiators continue to seek a compromise on the delayed funding deal to support Kyiv as it defends against Russia’s invasion, a joint statement released on Tuesday said. Ukraine has become increasingly desperate to secure funding from the West in recent weeks, with political delays to both US and European Union aid bolstering Russian confidence amid the bogged-down conflict. Having already handed Ukraine about $100bn in aid since the February 2022 invasion, President Joe Biden has asked the lower house Congress to approve another $60bn. However, Republicans have blocked the move, using the issue to demand new immigration legislation. Meanwhile, work is continuing in the upper house Senate to reach a compromise. “As negotiators work through remaining issues, it is our hope that their efforts will allow the Senate to take swift action … early in the new year,” Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Mitch McConnell said in the statement. “Challenging issues remain,” the statement continued, referring to US interests in Ukraine, Israel, the Indo-Pacific and along its southern border with Mexico. “The Senate will not let these national security challenges go unanswered.” For the remainder of the year, negotiators would “continue to work in good faith toward finalising their agreement”, they added. However, it is not clear that any deal reached in the Democratic-majority Senate would win support in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where a significant number of party hardliners oppose providing additional funding. The war in Ukraine, now in its 22nd month, risks being overshadowed by Israel’s war on Gaza that has been raging since October 7, aided by US financial support. The impasse over US aid to Kyiv is mirrored in the EU, where Hungary is blocking a 50 billion euro ($54bn) aid package. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged both Washington and Brussels to unlock the funds, warning that Moscow was counting on Western unity to “collapse” and of a “dire need” for weapons. In a press conference on Tuesday he said he believed the US “will not betray” his besieged nation. The Kremlin has celebrated the gridlock, and ramped up pressure on the front lines, where the war has largely become bogged down in trenches. As winter approaches, Russia has continued to focus on destroying infrastructure and attacking cities. Overnight on Tuesday, new air attacks targeted Kyiv and other regions. Air defence systems destroyed 18 out of 19 drones, Ukrainian military officials said on Wednesday. “According to preliminary information, there were no casualties or destruction in the capital,” Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration, said on the Telegram messaging app. Kyiv on Wednesday also reported that it plans to build more than one million drones in 2024, as it seeks to raise its own weapons production to reduce dependence on foreign shipments, which are struggling to meet earlier commitments. The strategy is also seen as a potential boost to the economy. Under the scheme, Ukraine hopes to produce one million FPV (first-person-view) drones, widely in demand on the front line, and more than 11,000 medium and long-range attack drones next year, Ukraine’s minister for strategic industries said. The White House has warned that by the end of the year, US aid to Ukraine will be depleted, but has been unable to push the package past partisan political interests. Zelenskyy faced a sceptical reception from Republicans when he visited Washington last week. Speaking on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president also expressed concerns about how US policies towards Ukraine could change if Republican Donald Trump is elected US president in 2024. “If the policy of the next president, whoever it is, is different towards Ukraine, more cold or more economical, I think these signals will have a very strong impact on the course of the war,” Zelenskyy said. Since Russian tanks first rolled into Ukraine, the Kremlin has bet that Western military support would ebb. Russian President Vladimir Putin is believed to be eagerly watching for signs that later this year Trump could offer his campaign significantly eased conditions. On Wednesday, he again slammed Western support for Kyiv, calling for a “severe” response to foreign agents who aim to destabilise Russia by aiding Ukraine. “The Kyiv regime with direct support of foreign special services has taken the path of terrorist methods, practically state terrorism,” Putin said in a video address.\\xa0“The attempts by foreign special agents to destabilise the political and social situation in Russia must be severely stopped.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed confidence that the United States and other Western countries will continue to support Ukraine in its battle to repel Russia’s invasion. Speaking during an end-of-year news conference on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said that financial assistance plays a crucial role in the country’s efforts to drive back Russian forces that poured over the border in February 2022. He also suggested that Ukraine could mobilise 500,000 more people in order to fight on. “We are working very hard on this, and I am certain the United States of America will not betray us, and that on which we agreed in the United States will be fulfilled completely,” Zelenskyy said. The address comes as support for Ukraine in Western countries comes under greater pressure, with conservatives in the United States expressing doubts about continued assistance and stalling the passage of a substantial aid package. Leaders in the US Senate said on Tuesday that the package was not likely to move forward before the end of the year. Zelenskyy, who has previously warned that such delays benefit Russian President Vladimir Putin, said that a Trump victory in the 2024 US elections could have “a very strong impact on the course of the war” if he pursued a policy towards Ukraine that was “more cold or more economical”. The Ukrainian leader also said that he was sure that the European Union (EU) would move forward with a 50-billion-euro ($55bn) aid package of its own, despite opposition from Hungary, whose right-wing government has raised objections to further assistance for Ukraine. “I’m confident that we have already achieved all this,” Zelenskyy said. “The question now is one of a certain matter of time.” However, support for Ukraine has become a divisive issue in Western countries after a long-awaited counteroffensive over the summer failed to win back substantial territory and the war grinds on. The Russian invasion, which has been accused of including war crimes, has devastated Ukrainian cities, displaced millions of people, and killed at least 10,000 civilians, according to the United Nations. Zelenskyy said that he is weighing the possibility of mobilising an additional 500,000 troops, adding that he had asked the military for more details on this “very sensitive matter”. Speaking on Tuesday, Putin said that Russia was open to negotiations with Ukraine, the US, and Europe but added that Russia “will not give up what is ours”. “The West isn’t abandoning its strategy of containment of Russia and its aggressive goals in Ukraine,” Putin said. “Well, we also aren’t going to abandon the goals of the special military operation.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Moscow is upgrading its nuclear arsenal and keeping its strategic forces at the highest level of readiness as the West wages a “hybrid war” against it. Moscow would continue what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, and all attempts to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia had crumbled, Putin told a conference of senior defence officials on Tuesday. The Russian leader also accused the United States of exploiting Europe for its own interests and said his country planned no war on Europe. Russia would be prepared to talk to Ukraine, the US and Europe about the future of Ukraine if they wanted to, but Moscow would defend its national interests, Putin said. “In Ukraine, those who are aggressive towards Russia, and in Europe and in the United States – do they want to negotiate? Let them. But we will do it based on our national interests,” he said. “We will not give up what is ours.” Russia would proceed from its own interests when dealing with Ukraine, regardless of Kyiv’s attempts to make any agreements, said Putin, who last week announced that his country’s goals in Ukraine remain unchanged and there will be no peace until they are achieved. Ukraine’s membership of the NATO military alliance “is not acceptable for Russia in 10 years, and not in 20”, he said. The president said Russia’s defence industry has reacted to the conflict in Ukraine faster than that of the West. Meanwhile, Minister of Defence Sergey Shoigu told the same meeting that Russia had increased tank production by 5.6 times since the start of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine last year, and had laid 7,000sq km (2,700sq miles) of minefields along the 2,000km (1,250-mile) front line. Moscow has demanded “denazification, demilitarisation and a neutral status” of Ukraine – which Putin has repeated since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russia has alleged that Ukraine’s government is heavily influenced by “radical nationalist” and neo-Nazi groups, which Kyiv and the West dispute.

       "  'Text': 'Volker Turk also says there are indications that Russian forces committed war crimes. The United Nations human rights chief has said there had been an “extensive failure” by Russia to take adequate measures to protect civilians in Ukraine and that there were indications that Russian forces had committed war crimes. Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said on Tuesday that his office’s monitoring indicated “gross violations of international human rights law, serious violations of international humanitarian law, and war crimes, primarily by the forces of the Russian Federation”. These included 142 cases of summary execution of civilians since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, as well as enforced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment of detainees, including through sexual violence. Russia has denied committing atrocities or targeting civilians in Ukraine. “The situation in Ukraine seems to have been added to a litany of continuous suffering, and the world’s attention seems jaded by the multiple crises that we face,” Turk told the Human Rights Council in Geneva. Russia has not taken “adequate measures to protect civilians” nor civilian infrastructure “against the effects of their attacks”, he said. The armed forces of both countries, particularly Russia, needed to abide by international human rights and humanitarian law, he added. “They must cease the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas, and scrupulously map the location of mines,” he said. On Tuesday, Russia’s Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu said that since the start of what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, Russian forces had laid 7,000sq km (2,700sq miles) of minefields along the 2,000km (1,250-mile) front line. During a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and senior defence officials, Shoigu also said that Russia had increased tank production by 5.6 times. Ukraine’s military has been feeling even more pressure on the front amid wavering support from the United States and some European countries. After weeks of effort to rally military and political backing with visits on both sides of the Atlantic, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy failed to convince the US Congress to approve $60bn in support while in Brussels, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban blocked some 50 billion euros ($55bn) in aid earmarked for Kyiv. Yet, the European Union invited Ukraine to open membership talks last week despite objections from Orban, who stood isolated in arguing that European Union financial resources should be saved for existing members. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron voiced commitment to Ukraine on Tuesday, saying, “Britain and France have been staunch supporters of Ukraine and we will continue to be for as long as it takes. “I have no doubt that we can make sure [President Vladimir Putin] loses and it is essential he does lose,” Cameron said after talks in Paris with his French counterpart Catherine Colonna. Cameron said that Western countries must work together to muster the “economic strength and that commitment pay” as the allies “outmatch the Russian economy by 25 to one or more”. Neither Cameron nor Colonna announced new aid for Ukraine in their comments to reporters. “Hand in hand since the beginning, our two countries are working together to ensure that the Russian aggression is not rewarded, is a failure,” Colonna said. Zelenskyy’s visit with leaders of Nordic countries last week did yield some positive results with Norway promising additional aid worth $275m. And Denmark said it would seek parliamentary approval for $1.1bn in new funds. Zelenskyy is set to hold an end-of-year news conference later on Tuesday.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'The popular novelist has criticised Russia’s war on Ukraine and previously called Vladimir Putin a ‘deranged dictator’. The Russian government has added the popular author Grigory Chkhartishvili – known by his pen name Boris Akunin – to a register of “terrorists and extremists” for his critical stance towards Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Rosfinmonitoring, Russia’s main financial intelligence body, announced that the detective novelist had been added to the registry on Monday. The 67-year-old is known for his historical detective novels and his longstanding criticism of President Vladimir Putin. “Terrorists declared me a terrorist,” Akunin, who lives in exile in London, wrote on Facebook. Separately, Russia’s Investigative Committee said it had opened a case against the Russian-Georgian author for allegedly “justifying terrorism and publicly spreading fake information” about the military. Russia adopted a law criminalising comments that discredit the armed forces following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Kremlin has since wielded those powers to crack down on critics. On the day Putin sent Russian troops into Ukraine, Akunin wrote on Facebook that the Russian leader was a “psychologically deranged dictator”. Speaking with Al Jazeera in March 2022, Akunin said that, even before the invasion of Ukraine, Putin had been “very methodically killing all the branches of democracy” in Russia. “We see what it has brought us to eventually: Russia, Ukraine, and now the whole world is seriously discussing the possibility of nuclear war in the 21st century,” he said. “This is all Putin’s doing.” One of Russia’s best-known publishing houses, AST, announced last week that it would no longer print or sell works by Akunin or Dmitry Bykov, another author critical of the war in Ukraine. The decision by AST followed the release of a prank call from the Russian prankster duo known as Vovan and Lexus, who spoke with the two authors posing as Ukrainian officials. Bykov told the duo that while he was saddened by the killing of Russian soldiers in the conflict, this was not something he blamed on Ukrainian officials. For his part, Akunin described Russia as a global threat and said that he was not bothered by Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian cities.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'The Russian president says Moscow has ‘no interest … to fight with NATO countries’. The Russian president has dismissed the United States’s claims that Moscow could attack a NATO country in the future as “complete nonsense”, saying such a conflict would run counter to his country’s interests. Vladimir Putin made the statement in an interview with Russian state TV on Sunday, weeks after US President Joe Biden warned that if Putin achieved victory in Ukraine, he might be emboldened to attack a NATO ally, sparking a third world war. “It is complete nonsense – and I think President Biden understands that,” Putin told state television channel Rossiya. “Russia has no reason, no interest – no geopolitical interest, neither economic, political nor military – to fight with NATO countries.” Putin added that Biden may be trying to stoke such fears to justify his “erroneous policy” in the region. US-Russia relations have sunk to their lowest level in decades since Moscow invaded neighbouring Ukraine in February 2022. Throughout the 22-month war, the US has provided Ukraine with $111bn in weapons, equipment, and other aid, helping the Ukrainians fend off Russia’s advance and regain some territory. Biden favours sending even more support to war-torn Ukraine, which is running short on supplies as it grinds to a bloody winter stalemate. He has asked US Congress to approve $61.4bn in support for Ukraine as part of a larger $110bn package that includes more funds for Israel and other issues. However, there is waning appetite in the Congress for the lingering war. Some Republican lawmakers have blocked the aid package, demanding the White House first take action on border security. Biden on December 12 said right-wing lawmakers’ refusal to approve the package also risked handing President Putin a “Christmas gift” of victory. “Putin is banking on the United States failing to deliver for Ukraine,” Biden said during a news conference with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “We must … prove him wrong.” While Putin dismissed the prospect of a direct NATO feud, he did address tensions with neighbouring Finland since it joined the alliance. Finland, which became a NATO member in April, on Friday shut down its entire eastern border with Russia, which it accuses of orchestrating a migrant crisis on its border. Putin said he would respond to the deteriorating ties by opening up a military zone in its northwest. “They [the West] dragged Finland into NATO. Did we have any disputes with them? All disputes, including territorial ones in the mid-20th century, have long been solved,” Putin said. “There were no problems there. Now there will be [problems] because we will create the Leningrad military district and concentrate a certain amount of military units there.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '16 Dec 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Even as the EU invited Ukraine for membership talks this week, deep divisions are now visible after a year of rare unity. The European Union hailed its next phase of expansion as a political victory this week when leaders invited Ukraine to open membership talks. That invitation, also issued to Moldova, delivered a message to Moscow that the EU would defend the right of former Soviet states to choose a Western orientation. Plunging the knife deep into the Caucasus, the European Council also recognised Georgia as a candidate country. These moves came over the objections of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who stood isolated in arguing that EU financial resources should be saved for existing members. Orban was persuaded to leave the room so the other 26 members could proceed with the expansion decision, but the stout Hungarian stood his ground in blocking approval of a 50 billion euro ($55bn) financial aid package to Ukraine over the next four years. A separate 20 billion euro ($22bn) military aid package for Ukraine also remains in limbo. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was “impressed” by Hungary’s stance. “Hungary has its own interests. And Hungary, unlike many other EU countries, firmly defends its interests, which impresses us,” Peskov said. During its first year, the Ukraine war appeared to give the EU a long overdue dose of political maturity and unity. The EU froze $300bn in Russian financial assets, unanimously approved 11 sanctions packages against Russia, provided Ukraine with 85 billion euros ( $93bn) in military and financial aid, and accelerated its transition to renewable energy sources as it weaned itself off Russian oil and gas. Yet European unity and resolve appear to have faltered in the second year of the war, analysts told Al Jazeera. A 12th sanctions package languished in intricate negotiations before it was finally approved on December 14 — with Russian diamond imports a key target. The energy transition slowed from a 20 percent increase in solar and wind power in 2022 to a 12 percent rise in 2023, according to Ember, an energy think tank. And as the December summit demonstrated, disagreement remained over the disbursal of EU funds to Ukraine. Most noticeably, Europe made little progress towards a more robust Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), continuing to entrust its security to NATO. The EU works on a consensus basis on major issues, where a single member can block a decision. “We have the phenomenon of countries who want to define themselves as middle powers … who want to have agency in a policy area and refuse to be boxed into binary decision making,” Jens Bastian, a fellow with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told Al Jazeera. “This is not an example of maturity, it’s an example of increasing transactionalism,” he said. Hungary, for example, leveraged its veto power to argue for the release of 10 billion euros ($11bn), a third of the funds the European Commission has withheld to press Hungary into scaling back political interference in the functioning of its judiciary. The EU’s sanctions packages have been rife with such transactionalism, said Bastian. The Czech Republic has requested an exemption from a ban on Russian steel imports, arguing it needs heavy steel plates to build bridges. “It has asked for an exemption not for one or two years, but until 2028. You’ve had two years [of war] to reconsider your steel manufacturing capacity,” said Bastian. It has taken until now for the EU to consider a ban on Russian diamonds because of concerns over how this will affect the Belgian economy. Some 90 percent of the world’s rough diamonds are cut in the Belgian city of Antwerp. And when the EU banned Russian oil imports a year ago, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic were exempted because they are landlocked and cannot receive crude oil from tankers. “I cannot remember the EU ever sanctioning one of its own members for sanctions-busting and one reason is the sheer amount of exemptions is so long,” said Bastian. The refusal to be inconvenienced has nowhere been clearer than in many EU members’ refusal to significantly raise their defence budgets. Germany grandly announced a 100-billion-euro ($110bn) increase in defence spending when the Ukraine war broke out. That money was supposed to have been spent two years into the war, but most of it has yet to be written into the budget. Last month Germany’s constitutional court told finance minister Christian Lindner he had to cut the 2024 budget by 60 billion euros ($66bn) earmarked for green initiatives. That’s because Germany has a constitutional obligation to limit its annual federal budget deficit to 0.35 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), and spending on Ukraine, rebuilding national defence, subsidising household energy efficiency and expanding renewable energy are all clamouring for fiscal attention. That is a problem in a European Union looking to its biggest economy to lead the way in greater defence autonomy. “Germany has pledged a lot but it has yet to deliver,” Minna Alander, a research fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs and a specialist on German foreign and security policy, told Al Jazeera. “It boils down to the question of, ‘Do we want to keep this constitutional [deficit] limit?… is there political willingness to change the thinking according to the needs that we have now,’ and we don’t see that right now … the sense of urgency is nowhere near there,” Alander said. She called it, “one of the biggest blows in the credibility problem Germany is facing”. Since World War II, Europe has not been – nor has it seen itself as – a major geopolitical force, ceding that status to Washington and Moscow during the Cold War. A series of efforts to introduce qualified majority voting in the European Council, making it impossible for any one member to veto a decision, faltered between 2002 and 2005. Had they succeeded, Europe would now be in a position to take foreign policy decisions by majority vote, and wouldn’t be hobbled by a single member, whether Hungary or anyone else. That in turn would enable it to posture as a “geopolitical union”, a phrase that European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is particularly fond of. Qualified majorities are vital in a diverse bloc where threat perceptions differ greatly, said Alander. “European countries have such differing perspectives on what is the greatest threat to their national security,” she said. During the Ukraine war, the EU states surrounding the North and Baltic Seas have advocated most strongly for a common foreign and security policy that actively anticipates a Russian future threat. They have argued that if Russia should get its way in Ukraine, they might be targeted next, as Putin’s Russia attempts to claw former Warsaw Pact countries back into its orbit. A recent opinion poll by the European Council on Foreign Relations found wildly differing majorities in favour of an expansion to include Ukraine – and even in Denmark and Poland, among Ukraine’s most ardent supporters, approval didn’t surpass 50 percent. “We have seen the birth of a geopolitical union – supporting Ukraine, standing up to Russia’s aggression, responding to an assertive China and investing in partnerships,” von der Leyen said in her last State of the European Union speech in September. That, believes Alander, is now a necessity, as US support for European security begins to waver. “The most likely thing to happen … is that US support for Ukraine becomes more conditional and less secure,” said Alander. “Next year it may be that we have to play a bigger role.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

Japan has expanded its sanctions targeting Russia over its war in Ukraine, banning Russian diamonds for non-industrial use and adding dozens of firms and organisations to its trade blacklist. The expanded export blacklist announced on Friday includes 57 organisations in Russia and six organisations in the United Arab Emirates, Syria, Uzbekistan and Armenia. The latest measures bring the total number of Russian organisations under sanctions to 494. Twenty-seven entities from Belarus, one of Russia’s closest allies, have also been sanctioned. The expanded sanctions come after the Group of Seven (G7) countries earlier this month held a virtual summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to show solidarity with Kyiv. Under Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Japan has taken a tougher stand against Moscow than any other country in the region, where governments have been hesitant to take sides in the war. During the G7 summit in Hiroshima in May, Kishida pledged “unwavering solidarity” with Ukraine while condemning attempts anywhere to use force to change the status quo. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a high-profile visit to Hiroshima during that summit to urge the international community to do everything it can to ensure Russia is the “last aggressor”. Tokyo, a key US ally and the only Asian member of the G7, has cast Moscow’s invasion as a threat to peace everywhere and linked the fate of Ukraine to the security of nearby Taiwan, which China has threatened to “reunify” with the Chinese mainland if necessary. Moscow last year blacklisted more than 380 Japanese parliamentarians in retaliation for Tokyo’s stance on the war, accusing the lawmakers of “adopting an unfriendly, anti-Russian position notably by expressing unfounded accusations against our country concerning the special military operation in Ukraine”.

       "  'Text': 'Veto came hours after the European Union agreed to open membership talks with Ukraine in a move Hungary opposed. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has blocked 50 billion euros ($54bn) in European Union aid for Ukraine, hours after the group agreed to formally open membership talks with Kyiv. Leaders meeting in Brussels said they would revisit the issue next month after Orban refused to back the additional funding for Ukraine’s government as it battles to remove Russian forces from its territory. “Summary of the nightshift: veto for the extra money to Ukraine,” Orban, the closest ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the EU, wrote on social media. The EU’s other leaders agreed to revisit the debate in January. “We still have some time, Ukraine is not out of money in the next few weeks,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters as he left the talks. “We agreed with the 26 countries. Victor Orban, Hungary, were not yet able to do that. I am fairly confident we can get a deal early next year. We are thinking of late January.” Rutte said another summit would be convened to reach a deal. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo stressed that the financial support was vital. “It is just as important that Ukraine has the means to continue the war and rebuild its country,” he said. Orban had promised to block the membership talks and the funding for weeks, and the decision was a blow to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who failed this week to persuade Republican lawmakers in the United States to approve an additional $61bn for Ukraine. Most EU leaders wanted this week’s summit to send a clear sign of solidarity with Ukraine amid perceptions, eagerly seized upon and repeated by Moscow, that allies’ support for Kyiv was waning. Critics have accused the Hungarian leader of holding Kyiv’s survival hostage in a bid to force Brussels to release billions of euros in EU funds frozen amid concerns about Budapest’s commitment to the rule of law. In what some saw as a last-minute concession, the European Commission, the EU’s executive, agreed on Wednesday to unblock 10 billion euros ($11bn) of the money. A further 21 billion euros ($23bn) remains out of Orban’s grasp, but he denied that there was any link to Hungary’s intransigence over Ukraine. “That’s not our style,” he said. The war in Ukraine has become bogged down on the front lines in the country’s east, where Putin on Thursday claimed his troops were making progress. The country currently has some 617,000 soldiers in Ukraine, he added, after launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Across Brussels, at NATO headquarters, the security alliance’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that the West must continue supporting Ukraine in order to protect the rest of Europe. “If Putin wins in Ukraine, there is real risk that his aggression will not end there.

       "  'Text': 'Moment of celebration turns bittersweet as Hungary carries through on threats to block financial aid for Kyiv. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed a “victory” for Ukraine and Europe after European Union leaders agreed to open membership talks with Kyiv, but the mood was soured just hours later when Hungary carried through on threats to block crucial financial aid to Ukraine. European Council President Charles Michel, host of the summit in Brussels, announced Thursday’s agreement on membership talks in a social media post, calling it “a clear signal of hope for their people and for our continent”. Zelenskyy welcomed the decision as “a victory for Ukraine. A victory for all of Europe. A victory that motivates, inspires, and strengthens,” he said in a post on X. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said it was “a strategic decision and a day that will remain engraved in the history of our union”. “These countries belong to the European family,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. The EU also agreed to open talks with Moldova and granted EU candidate status to Georgia. Michel said the block would also advance a membership bid by another hopeful – Bosnia and Herzegovina – once it reaches “the necessary degree of compliance” with criteria. But the mood changed early on Friday when Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, announced he had blocked a proposal to revamp the EU budget to include 50 billion euros ($54bn) in financial aid to Kyiv as it battles to remove Russian troops from its territory. For weeks, Orban had been promising to block the membership deal and the funding, which he said were not in the interests of Hungary or the EU. While Orban had agreed not to be in the room for the membership vote – allowing it to pass – the other EU nations were unable to overcome his resistance to the budget proposal put forward by Michel. “We still have some time. Ukraine is not out of money in the next few weeks,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters on leaving the talks. “I am fairly confident we can get a deal early next year, we are thinking of late January.” However, on Friday, Orban told Hungarians in an interview on state radio that Budapest could yet put a stop to Ukraine’s membership talks and he will not give a nod to the funding package unless Brussels releases billions of euros to Hungary that it has frozen due to rule of law concerns. It is widely believed that Orban has been complicating the EU’s efforts to help Ukraine not only because he is close to Putin but also as a way to force Brussels to release the frozen funds, which total more than 30 billion euros ($32.8bn). Stressing that membership talks would be long and complex, the Hungarian leader slammed the “bad decision” to invite Ukraine to launch the process. “Hungary bears no responsibility for this. We can halt this process later on, and if needed, we will pull the brakes, and the ultimate decision will be made by the Hungarian parliament,” he said. He also appeared to set out a clear quid pro quo regarding the funding. “I’ve always said that if someone wants to amend the budget law and they want to for several reasons, this is a great opportunity for Hungary to make it clear that it should get what it deserves – not half, then a quarter, but it must get the whole thing,” Orban said. While insisting that Hungary is not a pro-Russian country, the Kremlin on Friday praised Budapest for being prepared to defend its own interests. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned that Ukraine and Moldova could “destabilise” the EU should they join. “Negotiations to join the EU can last for years or decades. The EU has always had strict criteria for accession, and it is obvious that at the moment neither Ukraine nor Moldova meets these criteria,” he told reporters. “It is clear that this is an absolutely politicised decision, the EU’s desire to demonstrate support for these countries. But such new members could destabilise the EU, and since we live on the same continent as the EU, we, of course, are closely watching this.” Zelenskyy has been rallying allies’ support for his country as concerns grow that their backing might be waning. This week, he travelled to the United States, where he hoped to persuade Republican lawmakers to approve billions of dollars in new funding that they have blocked in Congress. US President Joe Biden has argued that their refusal to back the new spending plays into Putin’s hands. Ukraine launched its bid to become part of the EU after Moscow began its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and was officially named a candidate to join in June last year. Fellow former Soviet republic and neighbour Moldova\\xa0had applied at the same time as Ukraine. The\\xa0war in Ukraine\\xa0has breathed new life into the EU’s stalled push to take on new members as the bloc looks to keep Russian and Chinese influence at bay. In June 2022, the European Commission set Kyiv seven reform benchmarks to complete, including tackling corruption and curbing the power of its oligarchs, before talks should start. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmyhal said the EU’s decision on Thursday showed that it “highly appreciated the reforms we have made in recent years and the implementation of all the recommendations of the European Commission”. “A difficult path lies ahead. We are united and ready,” he said. EU treaties oblige members to help “by all means in their power” another EU country that is a victim of armed aggression on its territory. If Ukraine becomes an EU member while the war with Russia is continuing, EU countries would have to respect that. The EU would also acquire a long new border with Russia and Belarus with implications for security, migration and defence.               Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '14 Dec 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar says there is ‘some truth’ to accusations that EU employs a double-standard on Gaza. A growing number of countries in the European Union have expressed support for a humanitarian ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war as Israel’s assault on Gaza plunges the Palestinian territory into a dire humanitarian crisis. In remarks on Tuesday at an EU summit focused largely on Ukraine, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar urged his colleagues to take a firmer stance and call for an end to the fighting between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas in the besieged Gaza Strip. “I think the European Union has lost credibility because of our inability to take a stronger and more united position on Israel and Palestine,” Varadkar said. “We’ve lost credibility at the Global South, which actually is most of the world, because of what is perceived to be double standards. And there’s some truth in that, quite frankly.” Before the summit, Varadkar and the prime ministers of Spain, Belgium, and Malta wrote to European Council President Charles Michel asking him to host a “serious debate” about the Israel-Hamas war and the “humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza.” “We must call urgently for all the parties to declare a lasting humanitarian cease-fire that can lead to an end of hostilities,” the four leaders wrote.      The comments came several days after a large majority of nations represented at the United Nations General Assembly voted in favour of a resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire and the number of Palestinians killed in Israel’s assault on Gaza passed 18,000, most of them women and children. The resolution passed with 153 nations in support, 23 abstaining, and 10 voting against it. In Tuesday’s UN vote, 17 EU countries were among those that backed the call for a ceasefire. In October, only eight had backed a resolution calling for a truce. Varadkar insisted that a ceasefire could lead “to a new peace process and Palestinian statehood, which is the only way to secure justice and security for everyone living in the region.” Spanish Socialist leader Pedro Sánchez, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, backed his Irish colleague. “Europe has to speak out … in a clear, strong, firm and unified voice,” he said. The current round of fighting began on October 7 when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 240 others captive. Israel responded with a devastating assault on Gaza, bombarding the territory and launching a ground offensive, claiming that it seeks to topple Hamas. The Hamas attack was widely condemned, and Israel received strong international backing for its war against Hamas from the United States and several European countries. But as the Israeli assault continued, leading to dire humanitarian conditions and displacing more than 80 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, some allies have tempered their support with growing warnings about the toll on civilians. Western countries have also been accused of employing a double-standard, chastising Russia for violations of international law during its invasion of Ukraine but relatively muted when faced with similar acts by Israel.      Speaking on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said that Israel risks losing support due to “indiscriminate bombing” in a rare moment of sharp criticism. But despite mounting international pressure, Israel has shown no signs of scaling down its fighting in Gaza, where UN officials have described conditions as “hell on earth”. On Thursday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said that the fighting in Gaza would last “more than several months”.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '14 Dec 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Russia is making incremental inroads in eastern Ukraine and may soon hold the strategic town of Avdiivka. Kyiv, Ukraine – Russian forces are close to rolling into a Ukrainian stronghold of immense strategic and symbolic importance. Troops have almost surrounded Avdiivka, a southeastern town which has been nearly razed to the ground after almost a decade of assaults by pro-Moscow separatist fighters. The town is strewn with craters from explosions, burned-out armoured vehicles and the uncollected bodies of Russian soldiers and separatists who doubled their efforts in October. Avdiivka is just 20km (12 miles) north of the separatist capital of Donetsk and is crucial to the Kremlin’s objective of seizing the entire southeastern Donbas region that has been partly controlled by rebels since 2014. The Kremlin shifted to this strategy a year ago after its blitzkrieg to conquer all of Ukraine failed and its forces withdrew from around Kyiv and most of Ukraine’s north. But Kyiv’s long-awaited summer counteroffensive to regain areas lost to Russia last year hasn’t yielded tangible results. Ukrainian forces lack air support and medium-range missiles to disrupt Russian supply lines and break through heavily fortified Russian defence installations along the crescent-shaped, 1,000km-long front line. Counterattacking Ukrainian forces largely consist of recently trained servicemen who replaced dead and wounded veterans. They lack battlefield cohesion and had not expected to encounter thousands of kilometres of newly built Russian trenches and tunnels, some of which lie 30 metres (33 yards) underground. Moscow has also deployed hundreds of thousands of newly mobilised servicemen to man the defence lines and plant up to five landmines per single square metre of no-man’s land. As a result, Ukrainian forces have failed to achieve their goal of reaching the Sea of Azov and cutting off Russia’s “land bridge” to the annexed Crimean peninsula amid heavy, debilitating losses of manpower and weaponry, including Western-supplied armoured vehicles. Ukraine’s top military analyst warned that in the freezing winter months, the nation’s military will have to circle the wagons and focus on defence as they re-evaluate next year’s offence strategy with Western allies, increase domestic production of weaponry and mobilise tens of thousands more men. “These days, we are focusing on switching to defence, and, to boost its effectiveness, to equipping and mining the most threatening [front-line] areas and use this time to amass resources,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, told Al Jazeera. He and other analysts blame Ukraine’s failures on delays in supplies of Western weaponry as well as Russia’s prowess in the large-scale use of unmanned aerial vehicles, especially the FPV (first-person view) kamikaze drones. These inexpensive camera-equipped drones carry tiny explosives and can get into manholes or open hatches of armoured vehicles – all while their pilots operate them from safe hideouts. This year, Russia began the massive industrial production of FPV drones, while Ukraine still largely relies on the output of makeshift workshops, the numbers of which have mushroomed around the nation and where volunteers retrofit Chinese-made models. “This year, [Russians] managed to catch up with us and go ahead of us, and to produce large quantities of unmanned aerial vehicles,” Romanenko said. However, some analysts claim the advantages of FPV drones are somewhat exaggerated. “They’re cheaper and more simple, but also less effective in comparison with high-precision means of destruction, including advanced kinds of loitering munitions,” Pavel Luzin, a visiting scholar at Boston’s Tufts University, told Al Jazeera. To take over Avdiivka, Russian forces have to seize The Chemist, a district named after a nearby plant, according to Rybar, a pro-Russian Telegram channel. “This will let them bisect the Ukrainian grouping in Avdiivka, to break the unified system of defence and to significantly simplify the storming of the entire defence site,” Rybar, a primary source of news on the Russian offensive, posted on Monday. Moscow needs to take Avdiivka for publicity purposes. Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that he will run in the 2024 election and needs a victory that the Kremlin-controlled media can trumpet. “Putin needs such a victory ahead of the vote considering that the situation on the front lines is in a limbo for both sides,” Kyiv-based analyst Igar Tyshkevich told Al Jazeera. The Kremlin and its top brass largely ignore the plight of their servicemen who reach the front lines after no or next-to-no training and have been dying in droves. “To trudge two kilometres across the forest only to jump a machine gun and die within two seconds is the real-life story of a Russian stormtrooper,” a Ukrainian serviceman wrote on Telegram in August. This has led to catastrophic losses. Some 315,000 Russian servicemen have been killed or wounded since the war began in February 2022, amounting to 87 percent of Moscow’s active-duty ground troops, according to a declassified US military assessment released on Tuesday. Apart from the incessant storming of Avdiivka, Russian forces also intend to advance on other key areas of the eastern front – the towns of Kupiansk, Lyman and Bakhmut. The latter was taken over in May, mostly by Wagner mercenaries leading thousands of Russian prisoners who signed up for military service in exchange for a presidential pardon in what became known as “meat marches”. Over the following months, Ukraine retook key positions around Bakhmut – and Russians are dying in a bid to take them back. But real military triumphs are just not on the cards for Moscow, another analyst said. “One should not expect any breakthroughs for Russian forces. They hit in various directions, just a little. Spend the ammo they amassed, as well as contract soldiers and [recruited] inmates,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera. Russian forces may manage to seize Avdiivka, are likely to restore their positions around Bakhmut and improve their logistics by crossing the Zherebets river near Lyman, he said. “Russia will consider [these steps] the winter campaign’s large victory,” Mitrokhin said. At that stage, Moscow is likely to run out of soldiers and weaponry but, “this will constitute more territorial gains than those of Ukraine this year”, Mitrokhin added. No matter how minuscule, Russian advances will surely block any Ukrainian advance on the southern front, Mitrokhin said. Further south, on the Black Sea, Ukraine has the upper hand, however. During 2023, its sea and aerial drones downed several Russian warships and forced Moscow to relocate most of its Black Sea Fleet from annexed Crimea to the port of Novorossiysk. This has significantly reduced the shelling of Ukrainian coastal cities – and helped revive the “grain corridor” through which Ukrainian wheat is shipped to the Mediterranean. “That’s how we secured the functioning of the grain corridor,” Romanenko said. Meanwhile, Ukrainian intelligence has made inroads deep within enemy territory. Ilya Kyva, a controversial Ukrainian lawmaker with a pro-Moscow party who called for the mass killing of homosexuals and fled to Russia shortly before the war, was shot dead outside Moscow on December 6. He was reportedly about to record a video urging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to kill himself. Ukrainian media claimed the SBU, Ukraine’s main intelligence agency, was behind the killing. On December 1, explosions blamed on Ukrainian intelligence derailed two cargo trains on the strategic Baikal-Amur railway, paralysing Russia’s key transport link to China, North Korea and Japan. Russia announced the arrest of a Belarusian national with links to the SBU who allegedly planted the explosives. “The blowup of two fuel-loaded trains in a row, thousands of kilometres away from the front lines, in a strategic tunnel and at a detour line to paralyse central Russia’s and Siberia’s connection with the Far East, as well as China, North Korea and Japan, is an absolutely unique operation,” analyst Mitrokhin said.

       "  'Date': '14 Dec 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Putin remains tight-lipped on Russian athletes’ participation in the 2024 Olympics under the conditions imposed by the IOC. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the International Olympic Committee (IOC) of trying to bury the Olympic movement by imposing rules on Russian athletes for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. Last week, the IOC said Russian and Belarusian athletes who qualify in their sport for the Paris Games can take part as neutrals without flags, emblems or anthems. Russians and Belarusians had initially been banned from competing internationally following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, for which Belarus has been used as a staging ground. “If they continue to act this way, they will bury the Olympic movement,” Putin said on Thursday. While he promised to support Russians competing in Paris, he said his country should ponder whether it should compete if the event is designed to portray Russian sport as “dying” and not give a clear answer if Russian athletes should go to Paris. “To go or not to go? … The conditions must be closely analysed,” Putin said. “If they are politically motivated, artificial conditions aimed at cutting off our [political] leaders … and to weaken our team, then the Ministry of Sport and the Russian Olympic Committee\\xa0should make an informed decision,” he added. Speaking at his annual year-end news conference, Putin said a further assessment was needed of what the neutral status would mean for the country’s athletes. “They have been training for years … and that’s why I supported our athletes going to such competitions, but we still need to carefully analyse the conditions the IOC has put forward,” Putin said. “If the IOC’s artificial conditions are designed to cut off the best Russian athletes and portray at the Olympics that Russian sport is dying, then you need to decide whether to go there at all,” Putin said.      The IOC said neutral athletes will compete only in individual sports and no teams for the two countries will be allowed. Athletes who actively support the war in Ukraine are not eligible, nor are those contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military. Putin accused sports officials of acting “under the pressure of Western elites”. Russia has vigorously protested against the restrictions on its athletes, arguing that they go against the spirit of the games. “Everything that international officials do in relation to Russian sports is a complete contradiction and distortion of the ideas of Pierre de Coubertin,” Putin said, referring to the founder of the Olympic movement. Russian athletes have taken part in successive Olympics without their flag or anthem in the wake of major doping scandals. During the Cold War, the United States boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the Soviet Union and its allies retaliated with a boycott of the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.

       " {'Title': 'Russian court rejects appeal to release WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich',\n",
       "  'Date': '14 Dec 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'President Vladimir Putin says he hopes for agreement with US on prisoner swap but admits ‘it’s not simple’. An American reporter jailed in Russia must stay behind bars into the new year as he awaits trial on espionage charges, a Russian court has ruled. Evan Gershkovich, a Moscow correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, has been in jail since March on accusations of spying – charges that he, his employer and the United States government reject. A Moscow city court on Thursday upheld a November ruling extending Gershkovich’s pre-trial detention to January 30, 2024, as it rejected his appeal to be released. Russian President Vladimir Putin, at his end-of-year news conference on Thursday, said he hoped an agreement could be reached with the US about a possible prisoner swap for Gershkovich as well as former US marine and security executive Paul Whelan, also jailed on espionage charges. While Russia had ongoing contacts with the US over the issue, Putin said:\\xa0“It is not simple, I will not go into details now, but in general, it seems to me that we speak a language that is understandable to each other. I hope we will find a solution. But, I repeat, the American side must hear us and make an appropriate decision, one that suits the Russian side.” US ambassador Lynne Tracy, speaking outside the court, said:\\xa0“Evan’s ordeal has now stretched on for over 250 days. His life has been put on hold for over eight months for a crime he didn’t commit.” “It is not acceptable that Russian authorities have chosen to use him as a political pawn.” Gershkovich was detained by Russian authorities on March 29 in the city of Yekaterinburg, some 2,000km (1,243 miles) east of Moscow, and accused of spying, making him the first Western reporter to be held on such charges in Russia since the Soviet era. Russia’s Federal Security Service claims the reporter was “caught red-handed” trying to obtain secret information about a Russian arms factory. He faces 20 years in prison if convicted. Gershkovich’s legal team and his supporters have dismissed the charges as baseless – and Russia has not publicly provided evidence. The US has declared Gershkovich to be “wrongfully detained” and accused Russia of using him for “hostage diplomacy”.      This month, Washington said Russia had rejected a “significant proposal” to release Gershkovich and Whelan. However, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the setback would not “deter” the US government from “continuing to do everything we can to try and bring both of them home”. On Tuesday, Sullivan said Gershkovich’s release was a top priority for the White House. Gershkovich’s detention has unfolded amid heightened tensions between the US and Russia over the war in Ukraine and what Russia’s critics say is an expansive crackdown on independent media. The US is also looking into the detention of US-Russian dual citizen Alsu Kurmasheva, who was arrested in the central city of Kazan in October for failing to register as a “foreign agent”. Kurmasheva’s employer, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), this week denounced the new charges filed against her after reports that she has also been accused of violating rules against Ukraine war criticism. Russia and the US have agreed to several high-profile prisoner exchanges in recent years, including swapping jailed US women’s basketball star Brittney Griner for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout in December 2022. The Russian foreign ministry has said it would consider a swap for Gershkovich only after a verdict in his trial, which could last for more than a year.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Republicans say there is no hope for funding approval this year, but Europe may be gearing up for an invitation. Ukraine’s president spent the 94th week of Russia’s war rallying support on both sides of the Atlantic, as his troops continued to defend against constant Russian assaults to the east and south of Ukraine. Although battle lines have hardly moved in weeks, Russia is trying to take the initiative after a Ukrainian summer counteroffensive put it on the defensive. Zelenskyy’s task was to ensure Ukraine gets the money and weapons it needs to continue the fight next year, but a trip to Washington, DC, on Tuesday went unrewarded when a meeting with congressional Republicans failed to convince them to release $61.4bn in military and financial aid. Meanwhile, the US Senate voted 51-49 against a $110.5bn measure brought forward by the Democrats.\\xa0Even if it had passed in the Senate, the Ukraine measure would still have to meet with House approval, where Republicans also hold the majority and hold Ukraine funds hostage to a domestic agenda including abortion restrictions. “What the Biden administration seems to be asking for is billions of additional dollars with no appropriate oversight, no clear strategy to win and with none of the answers that I think the American people are owed,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said after his own meeting with Zelenskyy. “(It) is practically impossible – even if we reach an agreement – to craft it, get it through the Senate, get to the House, before Christmas,” Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters in the United States Capitol. “Make no mistake, today’s vote is going to be long remembered. History is going to judge harshly those who turned their backs on freedom’s cause,” Biden said in remarks at the White House. Earlier, Biden told congressional Republicans what was at stake besides border security and abortions, as he stood beside Zelenskyy. “Ukraine will emerge from this war proud, free and firmly rooted in the West – unless we walk away. But without supplemental funding, we’re rapidly coming to the end of our ability to help Ukraine respond to the urgent operational demands that it has. Putin is banking on the US failing to deliver for Ukraine. We must, we must, we must prove him wrong,” Biden said. According to documents seen by Reuters, while he was in Washington, Zelenskyy asked for new weapons and armoury including F-18 Hornet fighter jets, Apache and Black Hawk attack helicopters. He also asked for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) air defence systems to supplement Ukraine’s existing umbrella of medium and low-range systems. As part of the effort to convince Republicans to help Ukraine, the US intelligence community released a report that revealed how much the country had achieved with the $111bn in aid the US has already provided. Ukraine had destroyed 90 percent of the forces that invaded it in February last year, the report said, costing Russia 315,000 dead and injured troops from an original force of 360,000, and destroying 2,200 out of 3,500 tanks and 4,400 out of 13,600 infantry fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers. Russia continues to suffer high losses in Avdiivka, a city it has been trying intensively to capture since early October. US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson reportedly said Russian forces had suffered more than 13,000 casualties there in nine weeks. Ukrainian estimates run higher. The commander of Ukrainian ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in November alone Ukrainian forces “destroyed” 11,000 Russian troops and 130 tanks in the east. To regain the initiative in the east, Russian forces were sending troops in en masse, he said. “In the east, the loss of Russian casualties is approximately eight times higher than the loss of the Ukrainian defence forces. Despite this, the Russian occupiers are betting on human resources,” he said. Zelenskyy did not go home from his overseas visit entirely empty-handed. The US Pentagon announced $200m in new weapons, including air-to-air missiles on December 6. Meanwhile, following a summit with leaders of Nordic countries on Wednesday, Norway has promised additional aid worth $275m. And Denmark said it would seek parliamentary approval for $1.1bn in new funds. The biggest package may have come from the United Kingdom, which together with Norway, announced a new maritime capability coalition to strengthen the Ukrainian navy. The UK will provide two Sandown-class minehunters from its own fleet to help protect Ukraine’s grain corridor in the Black Sea. Together with Norway, it is to provide 20 Viking amphibious vehicles and 23 landing craft. “Ukraine’s economy continues to be impacted by Putin’s blockade in the Black Sea, which has significantly reduced the country’s ability to move vital exports by sea,” the British government said in an announcement on Monday. On Wednesday, the European Court of Human Rights held a Grand Chamber hearing in the case of Ukraine v Russia, in which Ukraine has accused Russia of human rights abuses in Crimea. Russia, however, failed to attend. Ukraine has four cases pending at the court against Russia, including one which has been filed jointly with the Netherlands. Ukraine might have a political prize to collect this year in Europe, where government leaders have been working to issue Ukraine an official invitation to start membership talks when they hold a summit on Thursday and Friday. “The EU wants to send a message that it continues to be interested in Ukraine,” Greek conservative parliamentarian Angelos Syrigos told Al Jazeera citing sources in the European Commission and European Parliament. “It is highly likely that there will be a green light for the start of membership talks at the next European Council summit. It wants to send a political message to Russia,” Syrigos said. “There’s a feeling it’s going to happen, that there’s no going backwards,” agreed Socialist European parliamentarian Nikos Papandreou. “The whole community has been voting for Ukraine across party lines, except some people on the extreme left and the extreme right – the people who said Ukraine will only last a few weeks,” he said. “[Fellow MEPs] don’t think there will be another chance because we don’t know what the political powers will be [next year]. It’s now or never.” Europe will hold a parliamentary election next June. On Sunday, Zelenskyy had what he later described as a “frank” conversation with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has emerged as a possible deal breaker. That was on the day of the inauguration of Argentina’s President Javier Milei, which Zelenskyy attended in Buenos Aires, alongside the leaders of Paraguay, Uruguay and Ecuador, whom he also met. On Wednesday, Orban reaffirmed his opposition to inviting Ukraine to start membership talks with the EU. “Considering the numbers, economic analyses and taking it seriously that talks (with Ukraine) would aim to grant membership … then we must say that this thought at the moment is absurd, ridiculous and not serious,” Orban said. Leading EU members want the invitation to go out this week. Spain, which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Council, is set on getting it done. “I kicked off the Spanish presidency with a trip to Kyiv and I hope to close it with the opening of accession negotiations with this country,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told a plenary session of the European Parliament. “I cannot imagine, I don’t even want to talk about the devastating consequences that will occur should the [European] Council fail to make this decision,” said Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba, calling it “the mother of all decisions”.

       "  'Text': 'The Russian president holds first end-of-year news conference since the Ukraine war began. Russia’s goals in Ukraine remain unchanged and there will be no peace until they are achieved, President Vladimir Putin has said in his first end-of-year news conference since the offensive began. The event on Thursday comes days after\\xa0Putin announced that he will run in the March 2024 presidential election, in which the 71-year-old leader is almost certain to win a fifth term. He has been in power for 24 years, including his prime ministerial stint, and a victory next year will see him remain president until 2030. Fielding questions from the public and the media in Moscow, the Russian leader said peace will be possible after “denazification, demilitarisation and a neutral status” of Ukraine – something he has repeated since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russia alleges that Ukraine’s government is heavily influenced by “radical nationalist” and neo-Nazi groups, which Kyiv and the West dispute. Putin has also consistently demanded that Ukraine remain neutral and not join the NATO military alliance. “As for demilitarisation, they don’t want to negotiate, so we are then forced to take other measures, including military measures,” Putin said. “Either we agree or we need to resolve [the issue] by force,” he added. Putin said there are some 617,000 Russian soldiers currently in Ukraine, including about 244,000 who were called up to fight alongside professional Russian military forces. But there was no current need for a further mobilisation of reservists, he added. He said an estimated 486,000 people had so far signed up voluntarily as contract soldiers, on top of the 300,000 people called up last year, and “the flow is not diminishing”. Last December, in a break from tradition, Putin cancelled the event. It was the first time in a decade he did not hold the conference. This year, key themes of the conference were the fighting in Ukraine, payments to soldiers and their families and the economy. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Putin said Ukraine had lost some of its best troops in an attempt to secure a foothold on the east bank of the Dnipro in the Kherson region. “It is a tragedy, I believe, for them,” he said. As the war approaches the end of its second year, Ukraine has achieved only small gains from a counteroffensive that began in June. Russia, however, has also made no tangible progress since capturing the city of Bakhmut at heavy cost in May. It occupies about a sixth of Ukraine’s territory but does not fully control any of the four Ukrainian regions it claimed last year as part of Russia. On the ongoing war and relations with the West, Putin said: “The unbridled desire to creep towards our borders, taking Ukraine into NATO, all this led to this tragedy … They forced us into these actions.” Meanwhile on Russia’s relations with China, he said, “the level of our ties with China is at an all-time high”. Putin also said it was important that United Nations mechanisms, such as the veto power of permanent member states of the UN Security Council, remained in place. Asked by a Turkish journalist about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, he said he hoped to meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in early 2024. And commenting on new Argentinian President Javier Milei’s plan to dollarise his country’s economy, Putin said it risked jeopardising the country’s sovereignty. On the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics, Putin said he was not against Russians competing, but that the country should ponder whether it should if the event is designed to portray Russian sport as “dying”. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) last week said qualifying athletes from Russia and Belarus – who had been banned from competing internationally following the invasion of Ukraine – could take part in the Games as neutrals without flags, emblems or anthems. “We still need to carefully analyse the conditions the IOC has put forward,” Putin said. “If the IOC’s artificial conditions are designed to cut off the best Russian athletes and portray at the Olympics that Russian sport is dying, then you need to decide whether to go there at all.”               Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'PM Viktor Orban promises to veto proposal on Kyiv’s EU membership as EU chief urges support for ‘strong’ Ukraine. The European Union’s executive will wait to unlock billions in development aid for Hungary from the bloc’s shared budget amid a deepening tug-of-war between the EU and Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s administration over support for Ukraine. The European Commission said on Wednesday that it is waiting for a final step from Hungary to unlock 10 billion euros ($10.8bn) that was frozen over concerns that Orban had damaged democratic checks and balances. The commission said Hungary’s latest judicial reforms must first be published in the country’s official journal to be fully enacted, which would then allow the executive body to unfreeze the funds. The EU was earlier expected to unlock the money to help sway Orban, who has threatened to veto Ukraine’s possible EU membership ambitions. But a senior Orban aide then demanded up to 30 billion euros ($32.4bn) in frozen aid be released, Bloomberg\\xa0reported. Orban told Hungary’s National Assembly on Wednesday that he would block a proposal to start talks on Ukraine’s EU membership at a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. Ukraine’s bid for membership requires a unanimous decision by the leaders of all 27 EU nations. Orban, who boasts strong ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, told lawmakers that bringing Ukraine into the EU would have unforeseeable consequences. “We are interested in a peaceful and prosperous Ukraine, but this requires the establishment of peace as quickly as possible and a deliberate deepening of the strategic partnership,” Orban said. “Everything has its appointed time, but the time for Ukraine’s membership in the European Union has not yet come.” Distrust of Orban has been running high in Brussels after bitter run-ins during his 13 years in power over the\\xa0rights of gay people and migrants in Hungary as well as tightening state controls over academics, the courts and media Addressing members of the European Parliament on Wednesday, commission President Ursula von der Leyen urged leaders to back massive financial aid for Ukraine and Kyiv’s ambitions for membership talks. “We must give Ukraine what it needs to be strong today, so it can be stronger tomorrow at the table when it is negotiating a long lasting and just peace,” she said. Besides Ukraine’s EU bid, Hungary has also consistently signalled that it would veto a financial aid package for Kyiv worth 50 billion euros ($54bn), a position that has frustrated other EU partners who stressed that aid for Ukraine and its eventual membership are crucial for Europe’s security. Critics accused Orban of trying to blackmail Brussels to gain access to the billions of euros in EU funding. In a bid to overcome Hungary’s objections, it was expected that von der Leyen’s commission would unlock the 10 billion euros for Budapest ahead of the Brussels summit. The potential move sparked accusations that Brussels was backing down in its standoff over the rule of law with Orban, but the commission’s decision on Wednesday to wait further raises the stakes for Orban. The EU’s executive has proposed that the Brussels summit take a decision to start EU membership talks with Ukraine once Kyiv meets four outstanding conditions. Von der Leyen said laws Ukraine passed last week – including on national minorities, an issue raised by Hungary – cleared three of the remaining tasks, meaning only one was missing: a new lobbying law to rein in oligarchs. Orban, who says the rights of tens of thousands of ethnic Hungarians living in western Ukraine are being denied, disputed this interpretation. Orban is seen as Putin’s strongest ally in Europe, even after nearly two years of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and Hungary also relies on Russia for much of its energy supplies.

       "  'Text': 'Officials warn number of injured could rise after second missile attack on Ukrainian capital this week. At least 53 people have been injured and a children’s hospital as well as homes damaged after Russia launched a missile attack on Kyiv in the early hours of Wednesday morning. People were woken by a series of loud explosions as air defence systems brought down 10 ballistic missiles aimed at the capital, with the debris falling on the eastern side of the Dnipro river that flows through the city. Ukraine’s national police said 53 people, including six children, were hurt in the attack with 18 people taken to hospital. Eighteen people have been hospitalised, it said in a social media post. “Just yesterday, (US) President (Joe) Biden and I agreed to work on increasing the number of air defence systems in Ukraine. The terrorist state demonstrated how important this decision is,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram, referring to Russia. The explosions blew out windows of residential apartment blocks as frightened residents ran onto the street. Falling missile debris left a vast crater in the ground and destroyed parked cars. “There was no air raid siren. At around 4am (02:00 GMT), I heard an explosion. We fled to the corridor, (the explosion wave) threw me into the doors,” Olena Ustinova, 45, a local administration clerk, told the Reuters news agency. “I\\xa0regained\\xa0consciousness\\xa0and started to shake the doors\\xa0but they were blocked. I shouted for help\\xa0from\\xa0my balcony and emergency workers came to help me.” Ukraine’s Armed Forces General Staff said Russia had fired Iskander-M ballistic missiles, as well as S-400s: extremely fast missiles intended for air defence, but which have also been used to hit ground targets. Windows and entrances at a children’s hospital in Kyiv’s Dniprovskyi district were shattered by the debris, but based on initial assessments, there were no casualties, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko. “These (ballistic) missiles fly at a speed up to 8,000km per hour,” Klitschko told Reuters while visiting a site near one of the damaged buildings. Kyiv military administration chief Serhiy Popko said 17 people, including seven children, were evacuated from a residential building in the district after debris hit a building and nearby cars, causing a fire. On Monday, a Russian missile attack destroyed several homes on the outskirts of Kyiv injuring four people and cutting electricity to more than 100 households. The attack came after Zelenskyy was in the United States, urging right-wing Republicans to back billions of dollars in new military aid for his country. US President Joe Biden warned the lawmakers they would risk giving Russia a “Christmas gift” if they failed to approve the assistance.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Ukrainian president goes on diplomatic offensive in Washington, DC to try and win over sceptical right-wing Republicans. US President Joe Biden has warned Russia was banking on the United States abandoning Ukraine as he promised visiting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy his full support and announced $200m in weaponry to help Kyiv push out Russian forces. The White House said the security package could be “one of the last” if Republicans did not approve the new military aid plan, which includes about $61.4bn for Ukraine as well as support for Israel and which is currently stuck in Congress. Biden said right-wing lawmakers’ refusal to approve the package also risked handing Russian President Vladimir Putin a “Christmas gift” of victory. “Putin is banking on the United States failing to deliver for Ukraine,” Biden said during a press conference with Zelenskyy after talks at the White House. “We must … prove him wrong.” Biden’s comments came as Zelenskyy went on the diplomatic offensive during his third visit to Washington, DC since Moscow began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. As well as meeting Biden, he aimed to appeal directly to Republican lawmakers, laying out the state of the war and Ukraine’s plans for victory in an effort to secure their support. Republicans have sought to link the spending to new measures on the US-Mexico border but also appear to be increasingly questioning the war itself. Zelenskyy stressed that supporting his country’s fight for its territorial integrity was about far more than Ukraine. “For nearly two years, we’ve been in a full-scale war – the biggest since World War II, fighting for freedom,” Zelenskyy said. “No matter what Putin tries he hasn’t won any victories. Thanks to Ukraine’s success – success in defence – other European nations are safe from the Russian aggression.” The Ukrainian president noted 600,000 troops were currently on the battlefield amid snow and freezing temperatures, and insisted there had been progress, notably against the Russian fleet in the Black Sea and establishing a new corridor for the safe export of Ukrainian grain. He said the goal in 2024 was to “take away Russia’s air superiority”. Following his more than one-hour meeting with lawmakers, he said that while the signals were “more than positive”, he would focus on action rather than words. Republicans, particularly those with the closest ties to former President Donald Trump, who is running again for election next year, appeared unmoved. Some questioned whether additional aid would really help Ukraine achieve a breakthrough. “I know everyone wants Ukraine to win. I just don’t see it in the cards,” said Republican Senator Ron Johnson. “What the Biden administration seems to be asking for is billions of additional dollars with no appropriate oversight, no clear strategy to win and with none of the answers that I think the American people are owed,” said House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson. Ahead of Zelenskyy’s meetings in the US, the Kremlin claimed that the aid already sent had failed to make a difference on the battlefield and that further US support would not be able to turn the tide. Russia has stepped up drone and missile attacks on multiple regions of Ukraine, amid fears it will again target power infrastructure during the coldest months of the year, with troops engaged in intense battles on the front lines in the eastern and southern parts of the country. Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed since Russia invaded, with many Ukrainians fleeing overseas. The US has said that while Russia appears to “believe that a military deadlock through the winter will drain Western support for Ukraine”, it has paid a heavy price for its invasion. Some 315,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since the war began, according to a declassified US intelligence assessment shared with Congress, amounting to about 90 percent of the personnel it had in February 2022. Ukraine has also inflicted heavy losses on Russia in recent fighting along the Avdiivka-Novopavlivka axis in the east — including 13,000 casualties and more than 220 combat vehicle losses, the report said. Zelenskyy was asked whether Ukraine might be willing to give up some of its land as part of a peace deal. He dismissed such suggestions. “How can Ukraine simply give away its territory? This is absolutely insane,” the Ukrainian president said. “Let’s be honest… Our people live there… our children. It’s a part of our society. We’re talking about people who live there.” Zelenskyy made his first visit to the US just days before Christmas a year ago. At that time, he received thunderous applause in Congress and many lawmakers wore Ukraine’s national colours of blue and yellow.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'New sanctions target entities and individuals around the world in bid to isolate Russia as its war on Ukraine continues. The United States has announced hundreds of new sanctions targeting entities and individuals across the globe, seeking to further isolate Russia as its war on Ukraine grinds on. The US Departments of State and the Treasury said on Tuesday that they had designated more than 250 individuals and entities in countries including Turkey, China, and the United Arab Emirates, cracking down on sanctions evasion, weapons procurement, and sectors such as energy and mining. “The Kremlin has steadily turned Russia into a wartime economy, but Putin’s war machine cannot survive on domestic production alone,” said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. “Our sanctions today continue to tighten the vise on willing third-country suppliers and networks providing Russia the inputs it desperately needs to ramp up and sustain its military-industrial base.”      The US Treasury said that among those targeted by the recent round of sanctions are those involved in weapons procurement for Russia, including four entities and nine people in China, Russia, Hong Kong and Pakistan. The sanctions also target those with connections to Russia’s energy sector, a crucial source of revenue for the Kremlin. The sanctions include companies working to develop a large natural gas processing facility in northwestern Russia that would be operated by Gazprom. The announcement came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Washington, DC in an effort to secure further military aid from the US, where conservative lawmakers have called continued US support into question. Assistance for Ukraine, which is fighting to eject Russian forces from its territory, has faced mounting opposition in the US and Europe, after a much-anticipated counteroffensive failed to produce substantial gains and the war continues with no end in sight. Russian officials have expressed confidence that they can outlast Western support for Ukraine, while Ukrainian officials have argued that continued assistance is a necessity and brings benefits to its security partners.

       "  'Text': 'The Ukrainian president is trying to help break a US domestic political deadlock that would deprive his country of war funding. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived in the US as part of his efforts to convince US politicians to not block military aid to the war-torn country. Zelenskyy is expected to meet US President Joe Biden, a staunch supporter of Ukraine in its war with Russia. “[Russian president Vladimir Putin] thought he could break you … he was wrong. He continues to be wrong. Ukraine is unbroken, unbowed and unconquered, proving that nothing can dim the flame of liberty that burns in the heart of free people,” Biden said in late last September when Zelenskyy had again visited the White House. Zelenskyy’s key meeting in Washington was likely to be scheduled with Republican and Democratic senators. The Republican Party has so far refused to even schedule a vote on President Biden’s request for $50bn in military aid for Ukraine next year and to replace US weapons drawn down for Ukraine this year. Senate Republicans last week blocked Biden’s $111bn bill, which includes military aid to Israel and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, from advancing to debate and a vote. They said the bill did not contain provisions to tighten border security with Mexico and restrict asylum and parole rights for refugees. JD Vance, the Ohio Republican senator, said he was “offended” by Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington this week, and it was “not the role of the United States here to hand out money to every beggar who comes into our country”. Asked whether he had any indications for a breakthrough in September, Biden had said, “I’m counting on the good judgment of the US Congress. There’s no alternative.” Biden has urged Congress to vote for Ukraine because it is both in the US interest and consistent with US values. “The entire world has a stake in making sure that no nation, no aggressor, has the power to take a neighbour’s territory by force,” he said in his meeting with Zelenskyy. “The American people will never waver in our commitment to those values.” Ukraine has witnessed an erosion in support on both sides of the Atlantic after a carefully prepared counteroffensive this year failed to achieve its strategic objective of driving a wedge into the middle of the Russian front. Some politicians have called for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia, something Zelenskyy presently refuses to do. On Monday, Zelenskyy spoke with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Buenos Aires, during the inauguration of Argentina’s President Javier Milei. Hungary has emerged as the European Union member most opposed to inviting Ukraine to start membership talks with the EU in this week’s summit or promising Ukraine $21.4bn (20 billion euros) in military aid next year. Zelenskyy has been coordinating strategies with the European Commission to break that impasse. “We are working to get an unconditional decision to start negotiations,” said Zelenskyy in a November 13 video address. “It is fundamental for Ukraine to implement all the recommendations of the European Commission.” But the US military aid is key, because the US has donated more than three times what Europe has donated in military aid ($111bn so far, versus Europe’s $29bn), and it also has the largest stockpiles of deliverable weapons in the West’s arsenal. That, says a former Republican congressional candidate, is precisely why the US needs to step back. “Republicans are reflecting the sentiment of many Americans who believe Ukraine’s fight is just, but believe that an additional $61.2bn in aid is excessive given that the US has contributed more to the effort than all other nations combined, while domestic concerns have been ignored,” Demetries Andrew Grimes, who stood for Florida’s 15th House district in 2022, told Al Jazeera. Grimes, who has also supported ending birthright citizenship, whereby people born in the US have the right to US citizenship even if their parents were not legal migrants, says the situation is critical. “6.5 million unvetted and undocumented migrants have entered the US since Biden took office,” he said, adding that a record number of immigrant arrivals on the southern border will lead to “another 5 million illegal” migrants entering the US within the next year. Biden said Ukraine was to receive its first M1-Abrams tanks next week, along with Hawkeye missiles, launchers and interceptors to protect its airspace. Apart from President Biden and the full Senate, Zelenskyy was due to meet with US House Speaker Mike Johnson. The Pentagon has started rationing its aid to Ukraine and has warned it could be stopped altogether by the end of the year. On December 4, the White House Office of Budget and Management wrote to Congress, warning that “without congressional action, by the end of the year we will run out of resources to procure more weapons and equipment for Ukraine and to provide equipment from U.S. military stocks”. The result would be to “kneecap” Ukraine’s armed forces just as Russia is pushing to regain the initiative on the battlefield, wrote Shalanda D Young, who heads the Office. “If Ukraine’s economy collapses, they will not be able to keep fighting, full stop,” she said. “Putin understands this well, which is why Russia has made destroying Ukraine’s economy central to its strategy – which you can see in its attacks against Ukraine’s grain exports and energy infrastructure.” Some US commentators believe the Republican stance represents Putin’s best hope of hobbling Ukraine’s war effort – especially once the US presidential election gets under way next year. “What’s going to happen to the American election?… Trump and what the Republicans represent does not help Ukraine, and could potentially make things easier for Russia,” retired Colonel Seth Krummrich, now vice-president of Global Guardian, a security consultant, told Al Jazeera. The White House has told congressional Republicans that domestic politics should not come in the way of US support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already put his own military budget in place. On November 27, he signed a 70 percent increase of defence and security spending next year, to a post-Cold War record $157.5bn – some 39 percent of the entire Russian budget. “Zelensky is likely to depart Washington empty-handed, but with a commitment of assistance through authorized US weapons transfers from allies, backed by a US pledge to replenish allies for their contributions,” said Grimes. On Monday afternoon, Zelenskyy received a boost from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which said it would disburse another $900m under its Ukraine programme. The fund has granted $4.5bn under the $15.6bn programme so far this year.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Moscow is ‘very attentively’ watching as US President Joe Biden and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet in Washington. Any further United States aid to Ukraine will be a “fiasco”, the Kremlin has said ahead of a meeting in Washington between US President Joe Biden and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Moscow is also “very attentively” watching developments as the two leaders are set to meet on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Zelenskyy’s visit is part of a last-ditch plea to US lawmakers to keep military support flowing as he battles Russia. As the Ukrainian leader visits the White House and Capitol Hill, Biden’s request for billions in additional aid for Ukraine and Israel is at serious risk of collapse in Congress. “It is important for everyone to understand: The tens of billions of dollars pumped into Ukraine did not help it gain success on the battlefield,” Peskov said, speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Tuesday. “The tens of billions of dollars that Ukraine wants to be pumped with are also headed for the same fiasco.” The Kremlin spokesman said the outcome of the meeting would not change the situation on the front line in Ukraine, nor the progress of Russia’s “special military operation” in the country. He added that Zelenskyy’s authority was being undermined by his government’s “failures” in the ongoing war. On Monday,\\xa0Zelenskyy warned that failing to\\xa0maintain support for Ukraine\\xa0would play into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Let me be frank with you, friends. If there’s anyone inspired by unresolved issues on Capitol Hill, it’s just Putin and his sick clique,” he said, speaking to soldiers at the National Defense University in Washington, DC. Zelenskyy and Biden have argued that helping Ukraine resist Russia’s invasion, launched in February 2022, is in the mutual interests of both countries as support for Ukrainian aid hits\\xa0political snags\\xa0in the US. During their talks, the two plan to discuss a way to rally support for the military aid plan primarily focused on Ukraine and Israel. Last week, Republicans blocked the plan after walking out of a classified briefing on Ukraine amid demands for US-Mexico border reforms. Some Republicans are opposed to giving a “blank cheque” for Ukraine. The US Congress has approved more than $110bn in security assistance for Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion but has not approved new funds since the Republican Party gained a majority in the House of Representatives in January. Biden has asked Congress to approve an additional $61.4bn in support for Ukraine as part of a larger $110bn package that includes more funds for Israel and other issues.

       "  'Text': 'Everyday Indians are less likely to keep up with the news about Russia’s war, as analysts say Western response to Palestinian suffering underscores double standard. Jaipur, India – Even though Ukraine lies 6,000km (3,728 miles), two seas and half a dozen national borders away from Ali Hussein’s hometown, the raven-haired 29-year-old tour guide still feels for the war-torn ex-Soviet nation. “India is close to Russia and we buy Russian weapons, [but] I am fully on Ukraine’s side,” he told Al Jazeera, standing next to one of the terracotta-coloured buildings that gave Jaipur, a megalopolis of 3 million people, its sobriquet of India’s “Pink City.” He was referencing New Delhi’s decades-old ties to Moscow dating back to India’s 1947 independence and the fact that over the past five years, India has gone on a $13bn spending spree on Russian-made weaponry. He also has personal ties to Ukraine. His cousin attended a medical school in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, like thousands of Indian students who brave harsh winters and a new language of instruction to get a degree at a much lower cost than at home or in the West. But Hussein is a rare exception. Dozens of Indians asked this reporter in 10 cities from Delhi to the Pakistani border a similar question: “Is the war over?”      Their lack of knowledge seems understandable. Europe’s bloodiest armed conflict since World War II is not top-of-the-hour or headline news any more. Since October, it has been eclipsed by the Israel-Palestine conflict. But the Middle East war has not only changed the news agenda in the Global South, a term meaning Latin America, Africa and much of Asia. It has also confirmed the worst fears of many in the region – that Western powers are far less likely to empathise with Palestinian suffering, compared with that of Ukrainians. “The confrontation between Israel and Hamas has not only boosted the Kremlin’s hopes of changing the mood around the war in Ukraine but also strengthened its belief that the Western-centric system of international relations is breaking down,” according to Nikita Smagin, an expert with the Russian International Affairs Council. The war in Gaza has also “nullified all the results of rapprochement between the West and the Global South, and in this context, the war benefits [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. Ukraine is well aware of the trend. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s trip to Argentina last week is widely seen as an attempt to win the hearts and minds in Latin America. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with widely-reported war crimes, the shelling of civilian areas and, threats to Europe’s largest nuclear station, was met with global condemnation. While Western nations were quick to support Ukraine, a sovereign nation with its own national identity that stood up to Russia’s occupation attempts, their backing of Israel’s operation in Gaza has raised doubts and sparked cries of hypocrisy. “The typical comparison people make between Ukrainians and Palestinians is how the West is treating the former so differently than the latter,” said Seda Demiralp, a professor of political science at Istanbul’s Isik University. European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, for example, has consistently condemned what she has called Russian “acts of pure terror” on civilians in Ukraine, but failed to criticise Israel for its brutal campaign in the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 18,000 people in just more than two months. The alleged double standards irk Global South nations. “People can argue endlessly about the reasons for the war in Ukraine, or Israel’s operation in Gaza, but for many the conclusion is obvious: the United States was critical of Russia when it killed innocent civilians in Ukraine and now it is silent when its ally Israel does the same thing in Gaza,” said Smagin. The latest episode of the Israel-Palestine conflict escalated after Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people and taking more than 200 captive. Israel responded quickly, promising to crush Hamas with its relentless bombardment. Malaysia was quick to accuse the West of “ignoring Palestinians” while providing “swift” support to Ukraine. “Why are there two different approaches? For instance, in the Ukraine crisis, the Western powers swiftly provided support to Kyiv. Unfortunately, when it comes to Palestine, it is entirely disregarded,” Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi reportedly said. Another point of tension is rooted in perception. Western media outlets cover the killings of Israelis in more detail than those of Palestinians – a macabre “Orientalism” that pays little attention to mass deaths in places like Afghanistan or Iraq in comparison with Western nations, a United Kingdom analyst says. “This kind of Orientalism doesn’t want to equal the deaths of Israelis and Palestinians, ignoring the fact that there are dozens of times more victims among Palestinians,” Alisher Ilkhamov of Central Asia Due Diligence, a think tank in London, told Al Jazeera. “And considering the whole history of Palestine’s occupation – thousands times more.” Even though czarist Russia wanted to invade India, post-colonial New Delhi developed cordial ties with Communist Moscow. India’s nationalist premier, Narendra Modi, has not joined the international choir of critics lambasting the invasion of Ukraine and New Delhi abstained from condemning the aggression in the United Nations. These days, the Russian-Indian trade is conducted in rupees, which New Delhi sees as a chance to make its currency convertible and more useful in global trade. This year, New Delhi saved $2.7bn between January and October by buying 70 million tonnes of discounted Russian oil, the Reuters news agency reported in November. And the Kremlin’s narrative seems to be especially effective in India, where 46 percent of Indians believed the Ukrainian government was under the spell of neo-Nazi ideologues – a baseless claim Putin has used to justify the war –\\xa0according to a poll by YouGov Cambridge, an international pollster, conducted in October 2023. Only 27 percent of those polled said Russia was to blame for the war, while 42 percent thought Ukraine was conducting mass murders and “genocide” of ethnic Russians. Meanwhile, some Indian observers saw Western sanctions on Russia as a new financial tool to keep controlling the global economy. “This led to fears that the dollar was being weaponised,” analysts Ashish Pandey and Garima Bora wrote in the Economic Times, an Indian online newspaper, in June. “Several countries were worried that the US could use the power of its currency to target them and hobble their growth,” they wrote.

       "  'Text': 'Louisiana’s booming natural gas industry is wreaking havoc on fishing community. Locals are protesting a potential new terminal. Travis Dardar, a fisherman and member of the Isle de Jean Charles Tribal Community off the coast of Louisiana, has twice been displaced by fossil fuels. Rising sea levels forced him and his tribal nation to move in 2016 from the island where they had settled in the 1830s to escape the Trail of Tears, the forced displacement of Indigenous tribes by the US government. “If anybody’s seen climate change, I’m that guy. I watched that place disappear right before my eyes,” he told Al Jazeera. He resettled in Cameron Parish, a Louisiana coastal community where he could make a living working in one of America’s largest fishing industries, but he was displaced again in August by the construction of Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass 2, a liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal that is being built to ship fossil fuels overseas. He took a buyout in August and moved away from the site and is now commuting two hours to Cameron for oyster season. He said LNG terminals are threatening his livelihood in the fishing industry. After a decade-long fracking surge, the United States has become the world’s largest LNG exporter. The Gulf of Mexico sits at the front lines of America’s LNG export boom with massive terminals expanding along the Texas and Louisiana coasts. Called “clean energy” by the fossil fuel industry, LNG is in fact mostly methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gases. President Joe Biden’s administration now faces a huge climate decision: whether to approve Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass 2 (CP2), one of more than 20 proposed LNG export terminals. CP2 can’t export to certain countries unless the Department of Energy rules it is in the public interest. The LNG would mostly be exported to Europe, which is moving away from Russian gas due to the war in Ukraine. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) will make a decision on CP2 as soon as this month. After FERC’s decision, the Department of Energy will determine whether an export licence for CP2 is in the public interest. Venture Global did not respond to a request for comment. In the past, the company has argued the project will bring more than 1,000 permanent jobs to Cameron Parish and LNG can replace coal in some countries to bring down emissions. But a new paper by a leading methane scientist found that, when the entire lifecycle of exported LNG is considered, it can be 24 percent worse than the lifecycle of coal. In November, Dardar travelled to Washington, DC, along with other Louisiana activists to protest CP2 in front of the Department of Energy and Venture Global buildings. He helped deliver a petition to the department with 200,000 signatures against the project. Louisiana is the largest seafood producer in the lower 48 US states. The industry has retail, import and export sales totalling more than $2bn and employs more than 26,000 people in the state. But Dardar said LNG companies have bought up and torn down the fishing docks, and the Coast Guard tells fishermen to get out of the way of the LNG tankers or they will be arrested. He said last year, a huge wave from a tanker ripped pieces off his boat. The oyster, shrimp and fish populations are vulnerable to climate change and oil spills. The region suffers frequent oil spills, including BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster in 2010, which spilled 200 million gallons (760 million litres) of oil into the Gulf of Mexico and took four years to clean up. Most recently in November, 1 million gallons (3.8 million litres) of oil leaked off Louisiana’s coast. If LNG construction continues, Dardar fears the fishing industry will collapse. “You’re talking about a shrimp-pocalypse,” he said. The US, the world’s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, is on pace to set a record for extraction of fossil fuels. That includes breaking records for gas production. In the process, not only is the US not on track to meet its emissions reduction targets, the emissions from exported LNG are not included in the domestic math and remain uncounted. Environmental groups, members of Congress and Louisiana residents are calling on the Biden administration to deny the CP2 permit. A group of lawmakers sent a letter in November asking Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to reject the project, saying the lifecycle emissions of all existing proposed LNG terminals would be equivalent to 681 coal plants. CP2 alone would amount to 20 times the emissions of the Willow Project, a controversial oil drilling project in Alaska that the Biden administration approved in March. Senator Jeff Merkley, one of the letter signers, told Al Jazeera: “The United States has been promoting a massive myth, which is that fossil gas is better than coal for the climate. That is a huge disservice to the world because it is scientifically wrong, and also it undermines our legitimacy in the climate conversation. It’s convenient because we’re shutting down coal mines and instead we’re increasing fracking and gas.” “We’ve built seven export facilities, and the next one, CP2, becomes a point where we can focus our attention on this — what is essentially a big myth, or a big lie perpetrated by the US government that undermines our efforts to have humanity address this key problem,” Merkley said. He said if the US isn’t doing its part on climate, it allows other countries to continue to extract fossil fuels too. “Because if America isn’t going to change its habits when it’s the biggest historical producer of carbon dioxide, [others can say] why should we change ours?” The fishing industry is not the only community impacted by the LNG boom. Residents living near the LNG plants are experiencing health impacts alongside climate change. Roishetta Ozane, founder and director of the Vessel Project of Louisiana and a mother of six children, was one of the activists who delivered the petition to the Department of Energy in Washington. She said the LNG terminals are polluting the air and sea level rises from climate change are submerging wetlands and replacing groundwater with saltwater. “There is nothing safe about LNG — it’s greenwashed and should be called LMG [liquefied methane gas] because of the methane pollution it emits,” she wrote in a text to Al Jazeera. “There’s only one person who can put a stop to this injustice: President Biden.” Cameron resident John Allaire, who worked for decades in the oil and gas industry before he retired, stood on his porch and looked down the coast, where only a mile (1.6km) away, he can see a huge flare from Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass, an existing LNG plant. The company’s proposed CP2 terminal would be built nearby. A horn sounded as a tanker next to the plant prepared to leave the dock. When Allaire first moved to his property in the 1990s, there was no industrial pollution, and he could see the stars at night. Now the flares light up the sky “like Las Vegas”. He and his wife often smell fumes from the plant. “When we get the wind out of that direction, it literally gets hard to breathe out here,” he said. He has experienced powerful hurricanes, including one in 2005 with a storm surge so high that it swept his house out to sea. The hurricanes leave debris in their wake that dries out and becomes fuel for wildfires. This year, Louisiana saw an extreme drought, and a wildfire threatened Allaire’s home before it was extinguished. “It’s silly, what we’re doing — this huge experiment to see how much carbon we can put into the atmosphere,” he said. He described a rush now to get oil and gas out of the ground and sell it as fast as possible. “It’s capitalism at its finest — just monetize it as quick as you can and to heck with the consequences.” Back on his boat, Dardar said he hopes the Department of Energy rejects the permit for CP2. “Don’t nobody come to Louisiana to see LNG plants. They come for the seafood. They come for the Cajun music. They come for the gumbo,” he said. “If they give them their permits, we’re gonna continue fighting, that’s for sure. I’m gonna fight until they put me in the ground if that’s what it takes.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

The Ukrainian president’s trip comes just before a crucial vote in the US Congress on further security assistance. While the US initially helped rally Western countries in support of Ukraine, political schisms have started to emerge as the war drags on with few signs of a breakthrough for either side. Support remains substantial, but in both Europe and the US, some right-wing lawmakers have sought to restrict or cut off continued assistance. Ukraine’s supporters have alleged that such hesitancy only serves to strengthen Putin’s hand. “Despite his crimes and despite his isolation, Putin still believes that he can outlast Ukraine and that he can outlast America. But he is wrong,” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in remarks on Monday. “America’s commitments must be honoured,” he added.      The US Congress has approved more than $110bn in security assistance for Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion but has not approved new funds since the Republican Party gained a majority in the House of Representatives in January. Biden has asked Congress to approve an additional $61.4bn in support for Ukraine as part of a larger $110bn package that includes more funds for Israel and other issues. Republicans have used their leverage to push for greater restrictions on immigration on the US border with Mexico, including reforms that would roll back access to asylum, in return for their votes.

A spokesperson for Alexey Navalny has said that the Russian opposition leader has been removed from the prison where he was being held and that his whereabouts are unknown. In a social media post on Monday, spokesperson \\u200b\\u200bKira Yarmysh said that it has been nearly a week since she heard from Navalny and that officials will not say where he was transferred. The United States has also spoken out about the incident. “We’re deeply concerned by these reports that he’s now been gone for allegedly a week and neither his representatives or his family know where he is,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters. “We’re going to work with our embassy in Moscow to see how much more we can find out,” he added.

A Russian court handed the 43-year-old Navalny a 19-year prison sentence in August on charges of “extremism”, which he maintains are politically motivated. That is on top of an 11-and-a-half-year sentence that he was already serving. In December, he also said that he had been informed of new charges against him under a penal code that covers vandalism. “They really do initiate a new criminal case against me every three months,” he said in comments issued through his associates at the time. “Rarely does an inmate confined to a solitary cell for over a year have such a vibrant social and political existence.” The spokesperson Yarmysh told the news outlet Reuters that Navalny’s current location is not known. “We don’t know where he is right now. He can be in any colony of special regime and there are around 30 of them in Russia, all over Russia,” she said. “We will try to go to every colony there is and look for him”.      The disappearance comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin prepares for an election campaign, hoping to secure another six-year term at the country’s helm.

       "  'Text': 'The decision raises logistical and security challenges for Moscow because of its limited control in the four regions. Russia plans to run next year’s presidential election in the four regions of Ukraine that it annexed in 2022. The Central Elections Commission said on Monday that voting would go ahead in Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson regions, according to state news agency Interfax. The plan will test security because Moscow’s military does not control all of the regions, although it has stepped up efforts to extend its grip. Meanwhile, Ukraine has already said that any Russian vote in the regions will be null and void and that it will prosecute any observers sent to monitor voting. Moscow’s ability to hold the election in what it calls its “new territories” is politically important for the Kremlin, but it raises logistical and security challenges because of Russia’s limited control in the regions amid the ongoing war since February 2022. Russia’s annexation claim was rejected as illegal by Ukraine and most countries at the United Nations General Assembly. The areas controlled by Moscow have been placed under martial law. President Vladimir Putin confirmed last Friday, in comments to Russian soldiers who have fought in Ukraine, that he will run again for president in the March election, in which he faces no serious competition.      Amid a campaign that has become bogged down in trench warfare, it appears unlikely that Moscow will be able to significantly increase its control of the four regions ahead of the vote. However, it is clearly keen to try. The Ukrainian military reported on Monday that Russian forces had unleashed a massive new offensive on the city of Avdiivka, which sits just northwest of the city of Donetsk and is key to efforts to secure control of the wider Donbas region. “The enemy launched yesterday massive assault actions with the support of armoured vehicles in Avdiivka and Mariinka directions,” military spokesperson Oleksandr Stupun told Ukrainian TV. There was no immediate comment from\\xa0Russia\\xa0on the fighting in the area. The front lines in eastern Ukraine have barely shifted over the past several weeks, but the fighting has been intense, Stupun said, adding that there had been 610 artillery shellings reported near Avdiivka in just the last 24 hours. Russia is trying to encircle the small city, which now has only about 1,500 people left out of its pre-war population of some 32,000. Russia\\xa0launched a renewed bid to capture Avdiivka more than two months ago and Moscow’s forces have been inching forward on the flanks to try to cut supply lines.

       "  'Text': 'Russia says it has arrested 18 Ukrainian ‘agents and accomplices’ who plotted to assassinate pro-Russian figures. Russia says that it has arrested a network of Ukrainian assassins targeting pro-Russian figures in the annexed Crimea peninsula. Moscow’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Monday that it has arrested 18 “agents and accomplices” of Ukraine’s special services. Several pro-Russian figures in Crimea and the occupied east of Ukraine have been attacked since the Kremlin launched its invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. The FSB said it made the arrests after discovering a weapons cache. Moscow accuses the Ukrainian agents of plotting to kill several pro-Russian government figures, as well as attacking Russian energy and rail networks. Among those pro-Russian figures targeted was the Moscow-appointed head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov. Oleg Tsaryov, a former member of the Ukrainian parliament, survived being shot twice in October 2023, in an attack Russia blamed on Kyiv. Claims of sabotage are rife on both sides of the war, and such operations are thought to have killed or wounded hundreds of thousands of soldiers and damaged both countries’ energy and transport infrastructure. On December 7, Russia said it arrested a foreign agent working for Ukraine’s secret services who blew up several Russian trains in Siberia believed to be carrying ordinances to the front lines. Russia’s claim that it has broken up the Ukrainian sabotage network comes amid fresh military strikes on Kyiv and fierce fighting in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine said on Monday that it had shot down eight ballistic missiles fired by Russia at Kyiv, in the first attack on the capital city in months. Four people were injured by shrapnel in the southeastern Darnitskyi district, police said. Meanwhile, Russian forces have reportedly stepped up their offensive on the eastern city of Avdiivka, which they have zeroed in on as part of their campaign to overtake the Donbas region. Ukraine said Russia’s military had launched “massive assault actions” on the city on Sunday, but that its defences held and the front lines hardly budged. The Russian military has focused on eastern Ukraine since abandoning an advance on Kyiv in the first days after the February 2022 invasion. Now, heading into the harsh winter, Ukrainians fear Russia will strike at their energy system for a second straight year. To shore up their defences, Ukrainian officials are pleading with Western partners for more military aid. However, there appears to be growing reluctance in the US and Europe to dole out the funds. In the US, Ukraine’s top single-country donor, the White House is struggling to convince Congress to approve a mammoth military aid package that includes $60bn earmarked for Ukraine. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will travel to Washington on Tuesday to make the case for more aid to US lawmakers.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Britain and Norway plan to help Ukraine bolster Black Sea security amid its war with Russia. The UK has transferred two minehunter ships to Ukraine as part of a new push to strengthen the country’s presence in the Black Sea amid Russia’s invasion. The UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced Ukraine’s procurement of the two Royal Navy vessels on Monday. The deal is part of a new Maritime Capability Coalition, led by Britain and Norway, aimed at providing long-term military support to bolster security in the Black Sea. The focus on maritime operations has increased after nearly two years of war. Ukraine has targeted Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, which is based in the annexed Crimea peninsula, as it has sought to use ships to export grain. “As an island nation with a proud maritime history, the UK and Royal Navy are particularly well-placed to support this endeavour, which will form part of a series of new coalitions formed between allies to ensure an enduring military commitment in support of Ukraine,” UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said, explaining how the warships are an important first step. “These minehunters will deliver vital capability to Ukraine, which will help save lives at sea and open up vital export routes, which have been severely limited since [Russian President Vladimir] Putin launched his illegal full-scale invasion,” Shapps said. “This capability boost marks the beginning of a new dedicated effort by the UK, Norway and our allies to strengthen Ukraine’s maritime capabilities over the long term, enhancing their ability to operate in defending their sovereign waters and bolstering security in the Black Sea.” The coalition will also work with the Ukrainian navy to expand its forces in the Black Sea, develop a Ukrainian Marine Corps and enhance the use of river patrol craft to defend inland and coastal waterways, the ministry said. The UK and Ukraine made the deal for the two minehunters in June 2021, before Russia’s full-scale invasion. Ukrainian soldiers have been training on the ships since last year. London has also provided military training courses to around 20,000 Ukrainians over the past year. The UK is the second-largest provider of military aid to Ukraine, after the US. The two Sandown-class mine countermeasures vessels were procured by Ukraine through UK Export Finance.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will travel to Washington, DC on Monday for meetings at the White House and the United States Capitol as right-wing US Republicans resist efforts to send more money to support Ukraine’s response to Russia’s full-scale invasion. In a statement on Sunday, the White House said US President Joe Biden had invited Zelenskyy to discuss the “vital importance” of continued US support for Ukraine’s defence and the “urgent needs” it faces. Zelenskyy is also expected to address US senators on Tuesday morning. An aide for US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson\\xa0said Zelenskyy would also hold a private meeting with Johnson who has been trying to link Ukraine aid to immigration reforms at the US’s southern border. The meetings come as Biden attempts to rally support for a $106bn military aid plan mostly for Ukraine and Israel, which Republicans blocked last week after walking out of a classified briefing on Ukraine amid demands for border reforms. Zelenskyy’s office confirmed the planned meeting with Biden, adding that key areas of discussion would include defence cooperation between the US and Ukraine, “particularly through joint projects on the production of weapons and air defence systems, as well as the coordination of efforts between our countries in the coming year”. Biden has warned of the risk of weakening US support for Ukraine and Shalanda Young, head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, reiterated those concerns on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday. “What happens if Putin marches through Ukraine, what’s next? NATO countries, our sons and daughters, are at risk of being a part of a larger conflict,” she told the programme. Republicans remained sceptical, however, with Senator JD Vance, a close ally of former US President Donald Trump who is campaigning for election again in 2024, dismissing the idea that the Russian president would put other NATO countries at risk. He told CNN on Sunday that he was opposed to what he termed a “blank cheque” for Ukraine. “What’s in America’s best interest is to accept Ukraine is going to have to cede some territory to the Russians and we need to bring the war to a close,” Vance said. Russia occupies about a fifth of Ukrainian territory. The funding row comes amid signs of fraying Western resolve on Ukraine after Kyiv’s much-heralded June offensive failed to make significant headway and Russia deploys more troops and steps up aerial attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure as temperatures drop to freezing. On Monday, Ukraine’s Air Force said air defences shot down eight Russian missiles aimed at Kyiv early on Monday with the falling debris injuring at least two civilians. The White House said Biden’s meeting will come at a vital moment, “as Russia ramps up its missile and drone strikes against Ukraine”. The US State Department announced last week a stopgap $175m tranche of new aid for Ukraine on Wednesday, including HIMARS rockets, shells, missiles and ammunition. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken insisted on Sunday that “Ukraine has done an extraordinary job” defending itself. “The choice is very clear,” he said on ABC. “If we do this and help Ukraine sustain the achievements that it’s made, help ensure that Russia continues to suffer a strategic failure in Ukraine. That’s one route to go. “The other route to go is to do something that the only people who are rooting for it are in Moscow, and maybe in Tehran and Beijing, which is not to provide this assistance,” he said.

       "  'Text': 'Speaking at the Doha Forum, the Russian foreign minister calls for international monitoring of the situation in Gaza. The Russian foreign minister says it is unacceptable that Israel is using Hamas’s October 7 offensive as justification for a collective punishment of Palestinians in Gaza and has called for international monitoring of the situation on the ground in the besieged enclave. Speaking virtually at the Doha Forum on Sunday, Sergey Lavrov told Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays the unprecedented attack by Hamas inside the Israeli territory did not happen in a vacuum. It was due to “decades and decades of a blockade [in Gaza] and decades and decades of unfulfilled promises to the Palestinians that they would have a state, living side to side with Israel in security and good neighbourliness”, he said. At least 17,700 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7 – 70 percent of them women and children, prompting rights bodies and experts to call it a “genocide”. In Israel, the revised official death toll from the Hamas attack stands at about 1,147.      Addressing the Doha Forum, a two-day global meeting being held in the Qatari capital, Lavrov said the ongoing war in Gaza is about “cancel culture” – a recent phenomenon that refers to the mass withdrawal of support to public figures or celebrities who did things in the past that are no more acceptable today. “Whatever you don’t like in the events which lead to a situation, you cancel,” he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called Israel’s offensive in Gaza a failure of US diplomacy and suggested that Moscow could be a mediator in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Moscow has also condemned this week’s US veto of a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s representative at the UN, said US diplomacy was “leaving scorched earth in its wake”. Shortly after Lavrov spoke at the Doha Forum, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a telephone conversation with Putin, expressing his “displeasure” at Moscow’s positions against Israel at the UN and other global forums. “The prime minister emphasised that any country that would suffer a criminal terrorist attack such as Israel experienced would act with no less force than the one Israel is using,” read a statement from Netanyahu’s office.      Lavrov’s comments to Al Jazeera came as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues to rage. Since February 2022, Ukraine has faced a full-scale Russian invasion that has seen its eastern territories occupied. Lavrov, however, dubbed it a “hybrid war on Russia launched by the United States and NATO”, adding that the Ukraine conflict is also based on cancel culture. “It is not a war of choice [for Russia]. It is the operation which we could not avoid, given the years and years of the US and NATO preparing Ukraine to be an instrument to undermine Russia’s security,” he said. Lavrov said the Ukrainian government had passed legislation intended to cancel “everything Russian”, including language, media, culture and education. “This [law] is against people who for generations have been living in eastern and southern Ukraine … The only thing the Western media is being encouraged to say is that Russia invaded Ukraine,” he told Bays. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, insists it was Moscow that spurred the current phase of “de-Russification efforts” in the country. “You are doing it – in one generation’s lifetime and forever,” he said in a televised address in March last year. “You are doing your best so that our people abandon the Russian language, because Russian will be associated with you, only with you, with these explosions and killings, with your crimes.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '9 Dec 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Some politicians, in Ukraine and elsewhere, question whether the country should hold a vote, despite legal restrictions. Should Ukraine hold a presidential election next March, when Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s term ends? Ukrainian society has answered with a resounding “no”. Since February 2022, Ukraine has faced a full-scale Russian invasion that has seen its eastern territories occupied. That conflict triggered Ukraine’s martial law, which temporarily suspends elections. But while the Ukrainian public has expressed widespread support for the postponement, some politicians – both domestic and foreign – have questioned whether it contradicts the country’s democratic ideals. Even members of Zelenskyy’s own government have signalled an openness to the prospect of holding a vote. “We are not closing this page,” foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told the annual World Policy Conference last month. “The president of Ukraine is considering and weighing the different pros and cons.” Still, when the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) held a nationwide poll in October, eight out of 10 respondents said presidential and parliamentary elections should be postponed until after the war is over. That same month, a survey by the International Republican Institute (IRI) corroborated that broad sweep of public opinion. Only two out of 10 respondents believed a presidential election should be held in wartime. Civil society groups have also backed that view. In September, 100 non-governmental organisations, both Ukrainian and multinational, signed a statement against holding wartime elections. It cited challenges including “the impossibility of ensuring the full participation of the military and voters abroad”. An estimated 6.3 million Ukrainians are currently refugees. Another five million are internally displaced. The statement also noted the possibility of a “lack of political competition”, given that rights and freedoms are narrowed under martial law. There are other practical concerns as well. Russia unleashes drones against Ukrainian cities almost daily and could target polling stations. Two-thirds of Ukrainians also believe that the country’s electronic voting system could be vulnerable to hacking by Russian operatives, according to the KIIS poll. Last month, all the parties in Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, agreed to postpone elections until after the war. Why, then, have some members of the Ukrainian government vacillated? One reason may be Russian propaganda, said Maxim Alyukov, a researcher specialising in media and political communication at the University of Manchester and King’s College London. “The decision not to hold an election is framed as a demonstration of the non-democratic nature of Ukraine and Zelenskyy’s lack of legitimacy,” Alyukov told Al Jazeera. “Some state media stories claim that, if the election is held, Zelenskyy will lose legitimacy because opponents will hold him accountable, demonstrating that he is immensely corrupt and incapable of managing the country efficiently.” Russia, however, has a strong incentive to question Ukraine’s democratic credentials. Such narratives can help isolate Ukraine from its Western allies. Already, Ukraine is passing reforms to promote transparency and the rule of law, in order to qualify for candidate status in the European Union. But “without legitimacy”, Alyukov said, Zelenskyy “will also lose support from the West”. Another reason for the continuing election debate may be pressure from conservative lawmakers in the United States. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, in particular, publicly pushed for an election after meeting with Zelenskyy in Kyiv last August. “I cannot think of a better symbol for Ukraine than to hold free and fair elections during the course of a war,” Graham said in a statement after the meeting.\\xa0“Elections would not only be seen as an act of defiance against the Russian invasion, but an embrace of democracy and freedom.” Not everyone believes Republican motives are pure, however. “This is political theatre,” retired US colonel Seth Krummrich, now vice president of Global Guardian, a security consultancy, told Al Jazeera. Republicans have long campaigned on cutting government spending, and if Ukraine is perceived as undemocratic, it would be easier to trim aid for the country off the US budget. Krummrich also explained that President Joe Biden’s public commitment to helping Ukraine has also turned the country into a useful political lever for Republicans. The Republican Party has made further aid to Ukraine contingent on the passage of stiffer asylum laws and more funds for border security, a popular issue among its supporters. “This is much more about US immigration policy,” Krummrich said. “The Republicans in the House are clearly holding the Biden administration to change their policy on the immigration side if they want to get funding for Ukraine, so this is basically a hostage situation.” Biden himself yoked immigration and funding for Ukraine together by putting them in the same bill, Krummrich added. “I don’t understand why they [Biden officials] would do this, because it gives all the leverage to the Republicans,” he said. In the American experience, a wartime election is feasible. Franklin D Roosevelt won an unprecedented fourth term as president in 1944 during World War II, but his country was not under occupation. Zelenskyy could arguably win an election. Against advice from his allies, he refused to negotiate away any part of Ukrainian territory to Russia before the invasion and refused to leave Kyiv when the invasion happened. His official goal remains the liberation of every square inch of Ukraine, and voters overwhelmingly support that goal in opinion polls. Zelenskyy’s approval was in the 80th percentile range in polling conducted in July and August. Zelenskyy has nonetheless taken a stand against elections. “We all understand that now, in wartime, when there are many challenges, it is utterly irresponsible to engage in topics related to an election in such a frivolous manner,” Zelenskyy said in a video address on November 6. “We need to recognise that this is a time for defence, a time for battle, upon which the fate of the state and its people depend,” he continued. “I believe that elections are not appropriate at this time.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '8 Dec 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': \"The athletes had initially been banned from competing internationally following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has given the green light to the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in the games next year as neutrals, drawing the ire of Ukrainian officials. Russian and Belarusian athletes who qualify in their sport for the Paris 2024 Olympics will be able to take part without flags, emblems or anthems, outside of team events and as long as they do not actively support the war in Ukraine, the IOC said on Friday. “The IOC essentially gave Russia the green light to weaponize the Olympics,” Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a social media post condemning the decision. “Because the Kremlin will use every Russian and Belarusian athlete as a weapon in its propaganda warfare. I urge all partners to strongly condemn this shameful decision, which undermines Olympic principles,” he added. The athletes had initially been banned from competing internationally following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but have since been gradually allowed back as neutral athletes in most sport. The IOC said eight Russians and three Belarusians are among 4,600 athletes worldwide who have so far qualified for the Summer Games, which open in July. They will only be allowed to compete in individual sports and no teams for the two countries will be allowed to participate in Paris. The IOC has also said that no state or government official from Russia or Belarus will be invited to or accredited for Paris 2024, but argue that athletes should not be held accountable for the actions of their governments. Russia’s Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin called the move “discriminatory”. More than 60 Ukrainian athletes have qualified for next year’s Paris Olympics. A total of about 11,000 athletes will take part in the games next year. Athletes and officials from Ukraine, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have repeatedly urged the IOC to exclude Russia and Belarus entirely. However, representatives of international sports federations and national Olympic committees had called for Russian and Belarusian athletes to be admitted under a neutral flag “as soon as possible”. Ukraine’s Sport Minister Matviy Bidnyi told the AFP news agency in advance of the decision on Thursday that Kyiv was concerned the move gave the impression that the IOC “does not want to demonstrate the necessary leadership in the matter of Olympic fairness and justice”. “As aptly stated by President Volodymyr Zelensky: ‘Obviously, any neutral flag of Russian athletes is stained with blood,'” said Bidnyi. “When there is a war and one nation with its passports is destroying another nation, then ‘neutrality’ becomes irresponsibility,” he said, adding that giving up their Russian passport was “the only possible way today for an athlete to prove Olympic excellence is his first priority”. Earlier this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the IOC of using the games as a form of “ethnic discrimination”.               Follow Al Jazeera English:\"},\n",
       " {'Title': 'Who is Ilya Ponomarev, the anti-war Russian renegade exiled in Ukraine?',\n",
       "  'Date': '8 Dec 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Ponomarev, once a liberal parliamentarian, has likened himself to Charles de Gaulle. Does he really pose a threat to Putin? Ilya Ponomarev was once a member of the Russian parliament, an unruly liberal tolerated by the leadership. These days, he’s on a mission to slay Vladimir Putin and his aides. “They should be terminated with an aspen stake through their hearts,” he wrote in his memoir, Does Putin Have to Die?: The Story of How Russia Becomes a Democracy after Losing to Ukraine. Exiled in Ukraine since 2016, Ponomarev is the political head of the Freedom of Russia Legion, a volunteer militia thought to include about 1,600 Russian dissidents and defectors using pinprick tactics to aggravate Russian troops with the aim of one day marching on Moscow. To some, he cuts a maverick, temptingly plausible figure. The 48-year-old compares himself to Charles de Gaulle, the French military leader who led his nation’s resistance to the Nazis from exile during World War II and later became president. Who is the man who has reportedly been giving Putin, the president who will run again next year, nightmares? A self-confessed “libertarian communist”, Ponomarev hails from an elite background, his mother having once sat in parliament, his grandfather a former Russian ambassador to Poland. Born in Moscow, the physics graduate started out as a tech entrepreneur, transferring his skills to the oil and gas industry. In his 20s, he worked with Yukos Oil, then chaired by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the oligarch now exiled in London. As he recounts in his book, he later worked with a TV company, almost striking a business deal with CNN that was scuppered by Putin. Such was his frustration that he decided to enter politics. In 2007, at the age of 32, he entered the Duma, elected on the ticket of Just Russia, a social-democratic party within the Kremlin-approved “systemic opposition”. Even so, Ponomarev stuck his neck out, invoking the “crooks and thieves” epithet for the ruling party that had earlier been popularised by Alexey Navalny, the opposition leader now behind bars. In 2012, he and fellow party member Dmitry Gudkov played a prominent role in the “white ribbon” street protests against Putin, decrying the alleged rigging of the 2011 parliamentary and 2012 presidential elections. The following year, he refused to support a law banning “gay propaganda”. However, Ponomarev definitively crossed the Rubicon when he voted against the annexation of Crimea in 2014. He was captured on camera, refusing to stand and applaud when Putin referred to “national traitors” – a term used by Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampf – in a key speech. That image was printed on giant pro-government street banners that also featured Navalny; Boris Nemtsov, who would later be assassinated; and other dissidents with the words “Aliens among us” emblazoned below. By 2016, he went into exile in Ukraine. Since Russia’s invasion began in early 2022, he has positioned himself as the public face of pro-Ukraine Russians, speaking not only for the Freedom of Russia Legion (FRL) in Ukraine but also the National Republican Army (NRA), a secretive network of partisans allegedly operating within Russia. Ponomarev also set up a wartime Russian-language opposition TV channel, calling it February Morning, in reference to when the war began. He used it as a platform to announce the NRA’s claim of responsibility for last year’s assassination of Darya Dugina, the daughter of one of Putin’s close political allies, on the outskirts of Moscow. US intelligence had blamed the car bombing on Ukrainian forces. Still, within Russia, he remains relatively unknown. “Average Russians don’t know much about what Ponomarev is doing right now because there is heavy propaganda, and it’s not within Putin’s interests to popularise or advertise him,” said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. The FRL is one of two Russian groups working within Ukraine to bring down Putin’s government. The other one being the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC). While both share the same aim, they are ideologically different. The RVC is commanded by a known Nazi close to the local Azov regiment, an ultra-nationalist volunteer military unit. Last May, the FRL and the RVC shocked the world with their joint cross-border raids on western Russia’s Belgorod region. It was the first time that partisans had entered Russia during the Ukraine war. Footage of the attacks showed a Russian officer lying face down in a pool of blood next to Russian passports at a border checkpoint in the town of Grayvoron. Ponomarev said Ukraine’s military intelligence is supporting his coup efforts. This year, he claimed a role in a drone attack on the Kremlin, saying his group had helped to smuggle the devices over the border. He also has suggested he was involved in the assassinations of war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky and pro-Kremlin novelist Zakhar Prilepin. But many treat his claims with scepticism. “He’s got no kind of background in military or covert operations. He’s entirely dependent on the Ukrainians. Probably Ukraine’s quite happy for him to kind of try and claim credit,” said Roland Oliphant, senior foreign correspondent with The Telegraph who reported from Moscow for a decade. The FRL is steered by the Congress of People’s Deputies, a shadow parliament of sorts that Ponomarev helped to set up. Based in Poland with members inside and outside Russia, it is hoping for Putin’s government to collapse and is working on a transition plan and new constitution. Congress leaders include Mark Feygin, a former lawmaker and lawyer who represented the Pussy Riot feminist, anti-Putin punk band. But the body lacks big names, like Navalny and chess grandmaster-turned-political activist Garry Kasparov, who are not keen on the FRL’s violent tactics. Ponomarev hopes to build a force that can march on Moscow. Could he succeed where Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin failed? The late Russian mercenary chief, who led the onslaught on Ukraine but fell out with Russian army leaders, staged a spectacular mutiny against the Kremlin in June, taking control of Russia’s military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don. He quickly called off the revolt, relocating to Belarus before dying in a mysterious plane crash two months later. “The power of Prigozhin was that he had all these nationalist Russian credentials. He’d led a force in Ukraine. He was clearly pro-war. He was clearly not a national traitor. I think that’s quite important to Russians,” Oliphant said. Stationed on enemy territory, Ponomarev has a bit of a PR problem. As Oliphant pointed out, he lacks elite support to mount a coup, particularly within the security services. “Are any of those guys in the FSB [Federal Security Service] and FSO [Federal Protective Service] and a whole string of other agencies going to do a coup on behalf of this self-proclaimed liberal who fled to Ukraine?” According to Seskuria, the Kremlin has quickly buried memories of Prigozhin’s coup. “A lot of things have changed, and the regime has become more ruthless,” she said. “The stakes are so high that I don’t really think Russians are ready now to speak out or go out onto the streets and protest.” Now on Russia’s “terror” list, Ponomarev has turned himself into a highly visible target. \\xa0But it doesn’t look like he’ll be sticking his “aspen stake” into the regime’s heart any time soon. “Maybe he thinks that he’s going to ride into Moscow on the back of an American or Ukrainian tank,” Oliphant said. “I think that’s the only way he’d get there to be honest.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '7 Dec 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Russia has arrested a Belarusian man it accuses of bombing two fuel trains on behalf of Ukraine’s secret services. The past week of Russia’s war in Ukraine was remarkable, chiefly for something that happened thousands of kilometres to the east of a hardened battlefront. In an apparent sabotage operation of breathtaking audacity, Ukrainian operatives blew up two freight trains in east Siberia travelling on a track believed to be used to shuttle North Korean-made ordnance to the Russian front lines in Ukraine. Details were sketchy, but some facts have emerged. A freight train caught fire in the 15km-long (9.3-mile) Severomuysky Tunnel in the Republic of Buryatia on the night of November 29, the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor’s office reported. Ukrainian media cited intelligence sources as saying four explosive devices had been planted on the railway, one of two rail links between Russia and China, reportedly also used for ferrying ammunition. “During the movement of the freight train, four explosive devices went off,” the Ukrainian intelligence source was quoted as saying. “Now the [Russian Federal Security Service] FSB is working on the spot, railway workers are unsuccessfully trying to minimise the consequences of the SBU special operation,” the source said, referring to the Security Service of Ukraine by its acronym. The train in question was believed to be carrying 44 cars of refined fuel. At least three were destroyed. A successful detonation might have disabled the tunnel, and that indeed appeared to be the goal of the saboteurs, who told Ukrainian media the route was “paralysed”. On Thursday, the FSB arrested a Belarusian man it said planted the train explosives on behalf of Ukraine’s SBU. Calling the incident a “terrorist act”, Moscow said the detained man’s handler was a Lithuania-based Belarusian linked to Ukraine’s secret services. Russian media said “the explosion seriously damaged the rails, and the leaked fuel flooded them”. Expecting trains to be rerouted through a northern pass of the Baikal-Amur track, the SBU apparently staged a second explosion on a second fuel train as it passed over a bridge in an unspecified location. Four fuel tanks were destroyed and another two were damaged. Ukraine has every reason to disable Russia’s rail links with China. North Korea is believed to have sent Russia more than a million artillery shells to discharge in Ukraine. Satellite images the Washington Post published on October 16 suggested that two Russian ships had successfully transported cargo from the North Korean free trade zone port of Rason to Russia’s port of Dunai several times since August. From Dunai, the containers would most likely traverse the vast Russian landmass via rail. A Washington Post analysis suggested shipments began in mid-August, and US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby confirmed on October 13 that as many as 1,000 containers’ worth of North Korean weapons had reached Russia between September 7 and October 1. Ukraine was also continuing to focus on disrupting Russian supply routes in Crimea. The Russian defence ministry said electronic warfare systems and air defences downed a total of 35 Ukrainian drones targeting the port of Feodosia in east Crimea on December 1. “Apparently, the Ukrainian Armed Forces intended to hit the oil depot and power plant in the city,” said one Russian report. It was not clear if any drones struck their targets. Russia launched more drones against Ukraine during the week – a total of 83 from November 30 to December 5. Ukraine’s air force said it downed 62 of them. Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said Russia had increased its own production of Iranian-designed Shahed drones, and they were likely to be Russia’s main weapon targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure during winter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also expected an intense Russian air campaign this winter targeting electricity and water utilities, he said in an interview with the AP. Resources were one principal criterion for success in the war, resolve was the other, said Nigel Gould-Davies, chief Eurasia analyst for the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a London-based think tank. He was speaking at the launch of the IISS’s flagship annual publication, the Armed Conflict Survey. “The GDP [gross domestic product] of the West vastly exceeds Russia’s by a factor of 12,” said Gould-Davies. “But … there are growing signs now, and more have appeared in the last few days, that… the West may be inferior in resolve. We have budget struggles in the [US] House [of Representatives] and now the [US] Senate and the EU is increasingly wrangling over budgetary support for Ukraine,” he said. House and Senate Republicans have been insisting on tying military aid for Ukraine to strengthening border security with Mexico, and a socially conservative agenda. Zelenskyy told the AP these tensions were frustrating, but he “can’t complain too much”. “Look, we are not backing down, I am satisfied. We are fighting with the second (best) army in the world, I am satisfied,” he told the AP, referring to the Russian military. He added: “We are losing people, I’m not satisfied. We didn’t get all the weapons we wanted, I can’t be satisfied, but I also can’t complain too much.” But there were also signs of dissatisfaction in Russia. A Russian opposition polling organisation, Chronicles, published a survey on November 30 suggesting that Russians who supported the war, opposed any withdrawal of troops before military aims had been achieved and supported heightened military spending had nearly halved during the year, from 22 percent to 12 percent. A consistent 39-40 percent during 2023 supported a withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine without Russia achieving its war aims.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '7 Dec 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The Kremlin has celebrated the gridlock, saying it hopes US lawmakers will keep axing Biden’s aid plan. Republican senators in the United States have blocked $106bn in new funding for Ukraine and Israel, rejecting appeals from President Joe Biden amid anger over the exclusion of immigration reforms they had demanded as part of the package. Biden had earlier warned of dire consequences for Kyiv – and a “gift” to Russia’s Vladimir Putin – if Congress failed to pass the measure, which includes about $61bn to help Ukraine keep up pressure on Russia during the freezing winter months, as well as help for Israel and Gaza. “They’re willing to literally kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield and damage our national security in the process,” Biden said. The entire 49-strong Republican minority in the upper chamber voted against the proposal, pointing to a lack of government action on the estimated 10,000 migrants crossing from Mexico into the US every day. “Everyone has been very, very clear on this to say we’re standing firm. Now is the moment,” Senator James Lankford, a lead Republican negotiator on immigration and border issues, told Fox Business ahead of the vote. “We’re completely out of control at the southern border, and it’s time to resolve this.” Citing aid for Israel, independent senator Bernie Sanders also voted against the bill, which needed 60 votes to pass. The Kremlin celebrated the gridlock in Congress, saying it hoped lawmakers would keep shutting down the White House’s aid request. “It is to be hoped that there remain enough people with sober minds among American congressmen,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday. Peskov added that the White House was trying to “scorch the money of American citizens in the furnace of the Ukrainian war”. Biden had previously pleaded with Republicans over the package, warning that a victory for Russia over Ukraine would leave Moscow in a position to attack NATO allies and draw US troops into a war. “If Putin takes Ukraine, he won’t stop there,” Biden said. Putin will attack a NATO ally, he predicted, and then “we’ll have something that we don’t seek and that we don’t have today: American troops fighting Russian troops”, Biden said. “We can’t let Putin win,” he said. Border security with Mexico has emerged as a major stumbling block to continued support for Ukraine, even as the White House warned this week that funds designated for providing aid to Ukraine would run out by the end of the year. House and Senate Republicans are backing renewed construction of a border wall, former President Donald Trump’s signature policy, while deeming large numbers of migrants ineligible for asylum and reviving a controversial policy under which asylum seekers are told to remain in Mexico while their immigration case is heard. Biden said he was willing to make “significant” compromises on the border issue but said Republicans would not get everything they wanted. He did not provide details. “This has to be a negotiation,” he said. Biden, who had discussed Ukraine in a virtual summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and G7 leaders earlier on Wednesday, said the US and its allies were prepared to continue supporting Ukraine in its 22-month war against Russia, which currently occupies about a fifth of Ukrainian territory. Zelenskyy warned the G7 that Moscow was counting on Western unity to “collapse” and said Russia had ramped up pressure on the front lines of the conflict. The precarious prospects for the aid package had been clear since a classified Ukraine briefing for senators on Tuesday saw several Republicans walk out, angry that there was no talk of border security. Zelenskyy had been due to address the meeting via video link but cancelled at the last minute. Senators of both parties have acknowledged the need to move quickly to secure a deal given that Congress has just a handful more days in session before the end of the year. Republican negotiators were expected to send a new proposal to Democrats after the failed vote. The president’s willingness to directly engage on the issue carried some political risk with some Democrats and migrant advocates urging him to reject sweeping conservative demands on immigration – which they say are akin to closing the border. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who voted against aid to Kyiv before he took on the job, has made clear he will not agree to send any more money without “transformative” changes to border policy. “The American people deserve nothing less,” Johnson said in a statement. The Louisiana Republican has also declared that any Israel aid needs to be offset with spending cuts, a policy Democrats, the White House and most Senate Republicans oppose. Even amid the disagreement over the new funding package, the US unveiled aid for Kyiv worth $175m from the dwindling supply of money that has already been approved. It includes HIMARS rockets, shells, missiles and ammunition.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Illia Kyva, declared a traitor by Ukraine, has been shot dead in a park in Odintsovo region in the southwest of Moscow. A former pro-Russian member of Ukraine’s parliament has been shot dead near Moscow in an assassination claimed by Kyiv. Illia Kyva, declared a traitor by Ukraine, was shot dead in a park in the Odintsovo region southwest of Moscow on Wednesday. Russian investigators said they have opened an investigation and a hunt for the suspect. “An unknown person fired shots at the victim from an unidentified weapon. The man died on the spot from his injuries,” Russia’s Investigative Committee said in a statement. News agencies, including Reuters and AFP, quoted sources saying Kyva was killed by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).      Kyva was a member of Ukraine’s parliament before Moscow invaded in February 2022, but had been in Russia throughout the war and frequently criticised Ukrainian authorities online. He had been sentenced in absentia by a Ukrainian court to 14 years in prison for charges including treason and incitement to violence. The day before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Kyva said the country had been “soaked by Nazism” and needed “liberating” by Russia – echoing talking points regularly advanced by Russian officials and on state TV. Speaking on national TV, Ukraine’s military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov said: “We can confirm that Kyva is done. Such a fate will befall other traitors of Ukraine, as well as the henchmen of the [Russian President Vladimir] Putin regime.” Yusov did not say who was behind the assassination. In a separate incident, a proxy lawmaker in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region was also killed in a car bombing attack on Wednesday, Russian investigators said. Oleg Popov, who served as a deputy in the pro-Moscow Luhansk regional parliament, was killed after the “detonation of an unidentified device in a car”, Russia’s Investigative Committee said, without providing more details.      Kyiv used to rarely comment on whether it was behind the killings of pro-Russian figures, both inside Russia and in parts of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces. But lately, it has started to claim responsibility for a number of attacks and openly threatened to hunt down other “collaborators” and “traitors”. Moscow has previously said Ukraine was behind other audacious assassinations deep inside Russia’s borders. In August 2022, Russian nationalist Darya Dugina was killed outside Moscow in a car bombing, while an explosion at a Saint Petersburg cafe in April killed Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky. Ukraine has not publicly claimed responsibility for those attacks, though US intelligence and media reports have linked Kyiv to them. Several lower-ranking Ukrainian officials and politicians who have welcomed Russia’s invasion and worked for Russian-backed authorities in occupied parts of Ukraine have also been killed.

       "  'Text': 'Athletes from both countries have faced sanctions in multiple sports but may be allowed to compete at the Paris 2024 Games under a neutral flag. Representatives of international sports federations and national Olympic committees have called for Russian and Belarusian athletes to be admitted under a neutral flag for the 2024 Games in Paris “as soon as possible”. Athletes have moved closer to being allowed to compete as neutrals at next year’s Paris Games after an endorsement at the Olympic Summit in Lausanne on Tuesday. At the summit, athlete representatives also asked for “clarity” on the issue, according to a statement published after the meeting. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) still has to make a final ruling on whether athletes from Russia and Belarus, a key ally for Moscow in its offensive on Ukraine, will be permitted to compete next summer. The IOC said international Olympic summer sports federations, continental associations of national Olympic committees, and the IOC Athletes’ Commission backed such a decision and now want a quick final decision as Olympic qualifiers are taking place. However, the IOC has repeated its stance that a decision will be taken “at the appropriate time”.      Athletes from the two countries have faced sanctions from a multitude of sports events since Russia launched its assault on Ukraine in February 2022. However, several Olympic sports have eased restrictions over the past year, allowing them to return to competition under certain conditions. In March, the IOC lifted an outright ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes, allowing them to compete as neutral athletes provided they did not support the Ukraine conflict and had no ties to the military. The IOC has “confirmed that the participation of such AINs [individual neutral athletes] in the Olympic Games could happen only under the existing strict conditions”. “Neither the qualification system developed by the respective International Federations nor the number of allocated quota places to a sport will be changed for AINs with a Russian or Belarusian passport,” its statement added. The IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) on October 12 for violating the territorial integrity of the membership of Ukraine by recognising illegally annexed territories. ROC has recognised regional organisations from four Ukrainian territories annexed since Russia’s invasion began in 2022. Russia’s Olympic body last month launched an appeal against its suspension by the IOC at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). In September, officials voted to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete at next year’s Paralympics under a neutral flag after deciding against an outright ban.

       "  'Text': 'Talks expected to focus on Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and oil market cooperation, says Kremlin spokesperson. Russian President Vladimir Putin, staking out a more influential role in the Middle East, will visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, and host Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Moscow the following day. The talks will focus on bilateral relations and the Israel-Hamas war, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday. Peskov said that discussions on oil market cooperation will be on the agenda of talks, as Moscow cooperates with all three countries through OPEC+, which is comprised of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia. “These discussions are held within the OPEC+ format, but of course, cooperation in this area is always on the agenda,” said Peskov. The OPEC+ group, which Putin helped create in 2016, announced new voluntary supply cuts last week, which met scepticism from the oil market.      Separately, Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov said that Saudi-Russian cooperation within the oil cooperation body was “fruitful”. “Fairly close Russian-Saudi coordination in this format is a reliable guarantee of maintaining a stable and predictable situation in the global oil market,” Ushakov said, according to Russian news agencies. Putin’s drive to bolster its ties with Gulf and other Middle Eastern states is part of his efforts to demonstrate that Western attempts to isolate Moscow through sanctions for its war on Ukraine have failed. The Russian leader has not made many international trips after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for him in March, accusing Putin of deporting Ukrainian children. Neither the UAE nor Saudi Arabia have signed the ICC’s founding treaty, meaning they would not have to arrest him if he entered their territories. With regards to Israel’s current bombardment of Gaza in retaliation for Hamas’s October 7 attacks, Putin has sought to cast the war as a failure of U.S. diplomacy, charging that Washington had opted for economic “handouts” to the Palestinians and abandoned efforts to help create a Palestinian state. He has suggested Moscow could play the role of mediator, thanks to its friendly ties with both Israel and the Palestinians, saying that “no one could suspect us of playing up to one party.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, expressed three wishes last month: he sought $61.4bn in funding from Washington for Ukraine’s war effort next year, $20.5bn from the European Union, and an EU invitation to start membership talks. Zelenskyy asked for his wishes to come true before Christmas, but it now seems possible he will not get any of them. On Monday, the director of the Office of Management and Budget at the White House wrote to Congress, saying 97 percent of approved funding for Ukraine had been spent. “I want to be clear: without congressional action, by the end of the year we will run out of resources to procure more weapons and equipment for Ukraine and to provide equipment from US military stocks,” Shalanda D Young wrote in her letter. “There is no magical pot of funding available to meet this moment. We are out of money – and nearly out of time.” Cutting funding would “kneecap” Ukraine, putting its forces on the defensive and possibly on the retreat, Young wrote.      On the same day, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban wrote to European Council President Charles Michel, telling him it was not realistic to expect EU member states to approve Ukraine’s funding or an invitation to start membership talks at a two-day EU Summit that begins on December 14. “I respectfully urge you not to invite the European Council to decide on these matters in December as the obvious lack of consensus would inevitably lead to failure,” Orban wrote. Both the United States and EU funding packages would need to be approved this month to come into effect next year and keep Ukraine’s artillery firing. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already put his own military budget in place. On November 27 he signed a 70 percent increase in defence and security spending next year, to $157.5bn, representing some 39 percent of the entire Russian budget. “Any discussion about the necessity of continuing military assistance to Ukraine must invariably be based on the sole (catastrophic) alternative – a ‘frozen conflict’,” wrote Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak on X on Tuesday. “This ‘frozen’ state is not in some abstract realm of ‘political expediency,’ but against the backdrop of a large-scale massacre of civilians, a major war, an enormous number of unequivocal war crimes and crimes against humanity … and the persisting insane desire of the Russian Federation to obliterate Ukraine’s agency,” Podolyak wrote. Funding for Ukraine was not the only national security measure the Republican-led House had left hanging in the balance. The Washington Post’s editorial board, in an opinion piece, said the US defence budget, a slew of military promotions and a reauthorisation of vital powers to intercept signals intelligence also needed to be approved before Congress retired at the end of next week. Congressional Republicans seek to advance a social and libertarian agenda in return for upholding national security and foreign policy. They have sought prohibitions for women in the military from travelling to other states for abortions; they want President Joe Biden to curtail asylum procedures at the border with Mexico, and waive his powers to grant humanitarian parole; and they want to defund the Internal Revenue Service. “The Biden Administration has failed to substantively address any of my conference’s legitimate concerns about the lack of a clear strategy in Ukraine, a path to resolving the conflict, or a plan for adequately ensuring accountability for aid provided by American taxpayers,” wrote House Speaker Mike Johnson on X. “Essentially this is now a political football where horse-trading unfortunately is going to be part of the final compromise they are trying to reach,” Jens Bastian, currently a fellow with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told Al Jazeera. But Republicans also have a valid point, Bastian said. “The Republicans are effectively pushing the ball indirectly into the camp of the Europeans, telling them, ‘If you don’t put more money or weapons on the table, then we are reluctant to compensate for what you are not doing’.” Europe has spent $29.2bn on military aid to Ukraine this year, compared with the US’s $62.3bn. As a confederation in which important spending and foreign policy decisions must be unanimous, Europe is subject to the differing opinions and perspectives of its member states. Orban, perhaps Russia’s closest ally inside the bloc, recently told party members Ukraine was “light years away” from joining the EU, a view squarely at odds with Germany’s strong support for Ukrainian membership. Ukraine says it has carried out seven key reforms to fight corruption and money laundering, limit the influence of oligarchs, secure the integrity of the judiciary and guarantee the rights of ethnic minorities. The European Commission agrees Ukraine is on track and should be invited to begin official negotiations this month. Orban is also China’s leading ally in the EU, receiving a relatively large share of Chinese direct investment in to Eastern European countries. He was the only EU member to attend the 10th anniversary of China’s Belt and Road Initiative in Beijing last September. Other EU leaders agree with Orban. Robert Fico, a former Slovak prime minister, won parliamentary elections in that country on September 30 on a pro-Russia platform. A week later he announced that weapons shipments to Ukraine would stop. Elections in the Netherlands last month gave primacy to far-right politician Geert Wilders, who has also opposed further spending on Ukraine.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'The governor of Russia’s Voronezh region says Vladimir Zavadsky died at a combat post in the ‘special operation zone’. The deputy commander of Russia’s 14th Army Corps, Major-General Vladimir Zavadsky, has been killed in Ukraine, a top regional official confirmed. Zavadsky died “at a combat post in the special operation zone”, Alexander Gusev, the governor of Russia’s Voronezh region, said on Monday without providing any further details. The “special military operation” is the term Russia uses to describe the war in Ukraine, which it launched in February 2022. Gusev paid tribute to Zavadsky, calling him “a courageous officer, a real general and a worthy man”. Zavadsky’s death marked the seventh major-general confirmed dead by Russia, making him the 12th senior officer reported deceased since the onset of the war, investigative news outlet iStories reported. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Ukrainian authorities reported that their military successfully downed 10 out of 17 attack drones launched by Russia overnight. According to the governor of Ukraine’s Lviv region, three drones targeted unspecified infrastructure, causing minimal damage with no reported casualties. Kyiv’s air force stated the drones were intercepted across “various regions”. Simultaneously, six S-300 missiles were reportedly launched at civilian targets in eastern Donetsk and southern Kherson. At the same time, Russian officials claimed their forces neutralised at least 35 Ukrainian drones. “An attempt by the Kyiv regime to commit a terrorist attack with aerial drones … was foiled last night,” the Russian Ministry of Defence said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that “22 Ukrainian drones were destroyed and 13 others were intercepted over the Sea of Azov and Crimea”. “A new attack attempt by the Kyiv regime” on Tuesday morning saw four Ukrainian drones shot down and two intercepted over the Sea of Azov, the ministry said in a separate statement. The Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, serves as the headquarters for Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and a vital supply route for their forces in southern and eastern Ukraine. The region is frequently subject to attacks from Ukrainian forces.               Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Concern is growing over Ukraine’s ability to continue its defence against Russia should delays of Western funds persist. Uncertainty is growing over Western backing for Ukraine amid Russia’s intensifying campaign to knock out the country’s energy infrastructure. The White House has warned the United States Congress that funds designated for providing aid to Ukraine would run out by the end of the year, in a letter made public on Monday. The European Union is also facing difficulties in agreeing on a new 50 billion euro ($54bn) lifeline for Kyiv. “I want to be clear: without congressional action, by the end of the year we will run out of resources to procure more weapons and equipment for Ukraine,” the director of the US Office of Management and Budget, Shalanda Young, wrote in a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson. In the face of an upcoming harsh winter of intensifying Russian assaults on civilian infrastructure, the lack of funding could mean defeat for Ukraine, warned the budget director. “If Ukraine’s economy collapses, they will not be able to keep fighting, full stop,” she wrote. The US narrowly averted a government shutdown last month, with a last-minute bill keeping federal agencies funded through the new year, but leaving out key foreign aid initiatives. The US, Ukraine’s biggest single-country donor, has sent more than $40bn in aid since Russia’s invasion in February 2022. In October, US President Joe Biden asked Congress to approve $105bn in national security funding, which would include support for Ukraine. But right-wing congressional Republicans have expressed increasing scepticism towards approving more funds for Ukraine and some $61bn in additional aid funds are now being held up by the US Congress. “There is no magical pot of funding available to meet this moment. We are out of money – and nearly out of time,” Young wrote, urging Congress to act “now”. At the same time, the EU is struggling to pass its own funding package, which would be part of the bloc’s future joint budget. Hungary has led arguments against the package. Prime Minister Viktor Orban has ploughed a pro-Russian furrow since Moscow’s invasion. He is also thought to be hoping to use his threat to block the plan to try to unfreeze 22 billion euros ($24bn) in funding for Budapest that Brussels is holding due to rule-of-law issues. The victory of the far-right in the recent Netherlands election and fiscal challenges in Germany are also complicating negotiations over the budget, the Financial Times reported on Sunday. The delay is endangering crucial pledges to Kyiv made months ago. A budget agreement would be “very, very difficult”, a senior official said. The 50 billion euro ($54bn) instrument proposed is designed to keep Kyiv solvent to 2027. A failure to approve long-term funding, as well as a separate 20 billion euro ($22bn) facility for weapons purchases, would hit Kyiv hard as the war grinds on. Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, last week described the EU summit as an “existential moment” for her country. The difficulties in securing the funds in Washington and Brussels have raised concerns in Kyiv that Western backers are experiencing “fatigue” with the drawn-out battle as fighting on the front line becomes bogged down in what some see as a “stalemate“. As Russia continues its campaign targeting civilians and infrastructure in indiscriminate bombings and drone attacks, Ukraine announced a 450 million euro ($489m) expansion of a wind farm in its Mykolaiv region on Monday at the United Nations COP28 climate talks. Ukrainian officials highlighted how its turbines would be spread far enough apart to survive any Russian missile attacks. Also speaking at the climate summit, US Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources Geoffrey R Pyatt denounced Russia’s targeting of energy infrastructure in the war, saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin “has made energy one of his weapons”. Pyatt, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, said that Putin has “done that with his drone and missile attacks on civilian energy infrastructure. He’s done that by turning off the gas pipelines in order to try to weaken Europe’s resolve to support the Ukrainians…” “For Vladimir Putin, energy is just about as much a part of his war strategy as are his tanks and his missiles,” he said. Russia has spent recent weeks launching dozens of attack drones and missiles at Ukraine in overnight raids targeting energy facilities and military sites. Ukraine’s air force said on Monday that it had shot down 18 out of 23 Iranian-made Shahed drones and one missile. Meanwhile, Russia was reported to have intensified attacks from new directions on the industrial town of Avdiivka on Monday. “The launching of new directions proves that the enemy has been given a command to capture the city at any cost,” Ukrainian officials said.

       "  'Text': 'President Putin’s decree takes number of Russian service personnel to 1.32 million amid continuing Ukraine war. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the country’s military to increase the maximum number of troops by nearly 170,000 people, as Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine continues into its 22nd month. Putin’s decree was released by the Kremlin on Friday and took force immediately. It brings the strength of the armed forces to 1.32 million service personnel and increases the overall number of Russian military personnel to about 2.2 million. “The increase in the full-time strength of the armed forces is due to the growing threats to our country associated with the special military operation and the ongoing expansion of NATO,” the Russian Ministry of Defence said in a statement. It said the order does not imply any “significant expansion of conscription”, and that the increase would happen gradually by recruiting more volunteers. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, said on Friday that more than 452,000 people were recruited to the military under contract from January 1 to December 1, 2023. NATO’s “joint armed forces are being built up near Russia’s borders and additional air defence systems and strike weapons are being deployed. The potential of NATO’s tactical nuclear forces is being increased,” the ministry statement read. Boosting Russian troops was an appropriate response to “the aggressive activities of the NATO bloc”, the ministry added.      This is the second such expansion of the army since 2018. The previous boost of 137,000 troops, ordered by Putin in August 2022, put the military’s numbers at about two million personnel and about 1.15 million troops. Last December, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu declared that the country needed a force of 1.5 million “to guarantee the fulfilment of tasks to ensure Russia’s security”. He didn’t say when the military would reach that size. The Kremlin previously considered the size of its military as sufficient, but the calculus changed after hopes for a quick victory over Ukraine – which Russia invaded in February 2022 – were shattered by fierce resistance. Russia had undertaken various efforts to give a boost to its army – including drafting conscripts, mobilising reservists, forming volunteer battalions and running campaigns to entice more men to enlist. Some media reports and rights groups say the Russian authorities have also offered amnesty to some prisoners in exchange for a tour of military duty. All Russian men from age 18 to 27 (or age 18-30 starting on January 1, 2024) must serve one year in the military. However, a large number avoid the draft for health reasons or deferments granted to university students.               Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",
       " {'Title': 'Lula faces numerous challenges as Brazil assumes G20 presidency',\n",
       "  'Date': '1 Dec 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Lula also takes over at a time of bitter internal divisions in the group, legacy of outgoing president Narendra Modi. As Brazil takes over the G20 presidency on December 1 from India, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will be challenged to fulfil his promise of holding up the interests of the global south amid two ongoing wars and a slowing global economy. Lula also takes over at a time of bitter internal divisions within the group, the legacy of outgoing president Narendra Modi, whose team, eager to force a joint declaration, ran roughshod over diplomatic niceties in closed-door meetings. Despite these hurdles, Lula is forging ahead and has announced Brazil’s three key priorities as head of the G20: social inclusion and the fight against hunger, phasing out fossil fuels in favour of renewable energy and reforming global economic governance. The Group of Twenty – the G20 – is a forum for the world’s largest economies to coordinate on key issues of global policy. Between them, G20 countries represent 85 percent of global output and two-thirds of the world’s population. The G20 is made up of the European Union and 19 other countries, a mix of advanced and emerging economies. At its G20 leadership summit in September, India invited the African Union – representing 55 countries from across the continent – to become a member of the group. This was seen as a step to underscore Modi’s self-prescribed role as “the mother of democracy … to mitigate the global trust deficit” between rich and poor nations. The G20 was founded in 1999, following the Asian financial crisis. Originally designed as a council for finance ministers to discuss macroeconomic policy, its scope has since widened to cover issues ranging from global development to climate change and gender equality. Critics, in turn, have dismissed the G20 as an ineffectual talking shop. In over 200 meetings, the group did coalesce around its yearly declaration. Otherwise, New Delhi only delivered one joint statement – on the African Union. Against a backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions, South Africa and Brazil have openly criticised Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. For its part, China hosted a delegation of Muslim countries in November calling for a ceasefire. Elsewhere, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has also undermined efforts at consensus-building. Despite maintaining a neutral stance on that conflict, India has become more critical of Russia in recent months. Modi has also pared back military purchases from Moscow and bolstered diplomatic ties with the West. Vladimir Putin, who is under an international arrest warrant for war crimes, declined to attend September’s gathering in New Delhi. President Xi Jinping of China also skipped the event, amid growing geopolitical tensions with India and deepening ties with Russia. That didn’t stop India from “turning the annual summit into a commercial for the personality cult of Modi,” said Jayati Ghosh, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “In practice, it was an ineffectual presidency,” with the host keener on boosting its domestic image than addressing global challenges. “While trying to project India as a global superpower, Modi passes on the baton with no shortage of problems … the world economy is slowing, climate change is looming and conflicts in the Ukraine and Palestine have undermined north-south relations,” she added. Ahead of this week’s handover, Lula informed a virtual summit of G20 leaders that “I hope this [Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire] agreement can pave the way for a lasting political solution to the conflict.” Brazil has long maintained support for a two-state solution. Since Hamas’s attacks on October 7 and the ensuing Israeli bombardment of Gaza, Lula has repeatedly called for a swift and definitive end to the fighting. In October, Brazil spearheaded a UN Security Council resolution which called for a pause in the conflict but was vetoed by the US. “Lula’s position on Israel is delicate, but he’s arguably the best-placed global statesman to try and stop the carnage,” added Ghosh. Elsewhere, Brazil’s president has irked Western leaders by suggesting that Russia and Ukraine share joint responsibility for their conflict. He has publicly backed both Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin to attend the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro next year. At the G20 summit in New Delhi in September, President Lula urged leaders to try and end world hunger by 2030. “Part of that could be achieved through the creation of a global task force against hunger,” a Brazilian government official, who asked not to be named, told Al Jazeera. “The task force would seek to rally support in areas like low-carbon agricultural research and farming insurance improvements, especially in food-insecure countries … that would require more funding from wealthy nations,” the source said. It’s not clear how likely it is that those would come through. Lula has also backed the idea of a minimum global corporate tax rate of 15 percent. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) plan, designed in 2021 to clamp down on tax evasion and stem decades of tax ‘competition’ between governments, could generate at least $150bn in additional global tax revenues annually. Almost 140 governments have signed up to the OECD agreement, and are at varying stages of turning the proposal into law. “By expanding the OECD’s scheme, Brazil also wants to ramp up investment in the green transition. Lula wants the G20 to deploy more funds in renewable energy and nature conservation projects,” the official noted. For years, Lula has lobbied to reinforce the role of multilateral bodies such as the United Nations to try and resolve global challenges. His commitment to diplomacy, however, goes beyond a penchant for consensus. At the UN General Assembly in New York in September, Lula defended the need to reshape the global governance system. “The unequal and distorted representation at the helm of the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and World Bank is unacceptable,” he said. In 2022, the IMF provided $160bn in SDRs, the Fund’s reserve currency, to European countries and just $34bn to all of Africa. “The unfair allocation of SDRs is only part of the problem,” says Rogerio Studart, a former Brazilian representative to the World Bank. “Fund quota limits are also too small for emergency lending,” said Studart. He was alluding to IMF programmes such as the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, where country grants are capped at 150 percent of their capital commitments into the fund. “These curb the amount of money available for climate disasters, especially in low-income countries. I think that Lula will try and raise country quotas for emergency lending, and attempt to reduce the conditions attached to these programmes,” he added, pointing out that its success was unclear as this had been tried for years,” Studart also dismissed the World Bank’s “cautious” approach to risk tolerance. “The Bank can raise considerably more money for developing countries by adjusting its loan-to-equity ratio,” he said. A higher ratio would add to the Bank’s lending capacity, but come with a higher risk of non-repayment. His remarks echo a G20 report published in July which said that by raising their lending ratio slightly, groups like the World Bank could unlock billions of extra dollars in new lending. “Brazil will echo the findings from the report,” Studart said. For Ghosh, the economics professor, “Lula is nothing if not pragmatic. Where the previous G20 presidency was more about domestic politics, Lula is the ideal candidate to try and restore a measure of stability to today’s fractious world order.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'The FSB said that the suspect was trained by special forces of NATO member Latvia to bomb a railway and military base. Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has arrested a man with dual Russian-Italian citizenship for conducting sabotage operations for Ukrainian military intelligence. Moscow said on Friday that the suspect had carried out bomb attacks on railways after being recruited by Kyiv earlier this year. Infrastructure and production facilities across Russia have been damaged in unclaimed attacks since its military forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022, with investigators opening dozens of cases. The suspect is accused of planting explosives to derail a 15-carriage train in the Ryazan region, southeast of the capital, in early November. The FSB also says that he bombed the Dyagilevo military airfield in July, according to state news agency TASS. “The perpetrator turned out to be a resident of the Ryazan Region born in 1988 with Russian and Italian citizenship. The detainee gave confessionary evidence during his questioning,” the FSB’s Investigative Committee said in a statement. The intelligence agency said that the suspect was recruited by Ukrainian military intelligence in Istanbul in February. He then received sabotage training from Latvian special services in the EU and NATO member state, it added. The statement also said that a search of the suspect’s home unearthed explosives and other bomb-making equipment, and investigations are under way to establish his role in other acts of sabotage. The highest profile Ukrainian attack on Russian infrastructure since the start of the war came in October 2022, when the Kerch Strait Bridge, linking the Crimean Peninsula with Russia, was bombed. Shortly after the blast, the FSB arrested five Russians and three others, who were citizens of Ukraine and Armenia. Sources claimed on Thursday that the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) had bombed a railway line in Siberia, illustrating its reach deep inside Russia. The attack paralysed “the only serious railroad connection between Russia and China,” used by Moscow for military supplies, the Espreso TV website reported. Russia is also busy targeting Ukrainian infrastructure and has raised the level of drone and missile attacks as winter approaches. While the war on the front lines has become bogged down, Moscow’s forces aim to repeat the tactic of last year, when strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure plunged the country into the cold and dark for extended periods. The Ukrainian military reported on Friday that it had shot down 18 of 25 attack drones, and one of two cruise missiles launched against the country by Russia overnight, mainly targeting southern and eastern regions. Ukrainian air defence systems have been boosted with Western weapons since last winter, but Kyiv continues to stress that it needs more supplies to withstand the barrage.

       "  'Date': '30 Nov 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Neither side is ready to give up, and neither can win in the medium term, but negotiations could come next year. This winter is likely to see a long and bloody stalemate in Ukraine, with neither side backing down from offensives and counteroffensives, but may sow the seed of negotiations next year, experts tell Al Jazeera. “The winter is just going to reinforce the misery … neither side is going to have a tactical or operational breakthrough,” retired colonel Seth Krummrich, now vice president at Global Guardian, a security consultancy, told Al Jazeera. Ukraine launched a major counteroffensive in early June that by some estimates took back half the land Russia had seized earlier in the year. But it failed in its strategic objective of cutting Russian forces in two, isolating Kherson, Zaporizhia and Crimea from Luhansk, Donetsk and Kharkiv. Ukrainian senior commanders have said the counteroffensive will continue through the winter. Last month Russia attempted to answer with a new set of offensives in the east – headed towards the cities of Kupiansk, Lyman, Avdiivka and Mariinka. None has succeeded, but Russia has continued the assaults despite snow and frost, as evidenced near Kupiansk on November 21. “I think they’re going to try to push through in the winter,” said Krummrich. “The ground freezes, [they’ll] try to make some moves because they’re desperate. I don’t mean the Ukrainians. I mean the Russians. The soldiers won’t want to do it. It will be a disaster. There will be more dead bodies,” he said. That is already evident. Ukraine’s armed forces estimate 6,260 Russian deaths in the week of November 20-26, an average of almost 1,000 a day – the result of relentless Russian attacks in the east. “This is a war that lacks high strategy,” Konstantinos Grivas, who teaches weapons systems and geopolitics at the Hellenic Army Academy, told Al Jazeera. “Russia became trapped in an attrition war, which has its own logic … it’s a war on autopilot.”  Both sides have failed to come up with a technological or tactical advantage that would produce a breakthrough because defence is dominant, said Grivas. “Firepower and passive defences – minefields, trenches for instance – seem to have neutralised the capabilities of mechanised and airborne forces,” said Grivas. “If there is a critical development it will be a collapse due to exhaustion – like a boxing match where one fighter simply can’t take the blows, but not from a knock-out punch.” Both sides have had strategies for success, but all have so far been parried. Russia had hoped for a quick collapse of the Ukrainian armed forces when it invaded in February 2022. When that failed, it rained down some 10,000 missiles on Ukraine’s cities to break the country’s will to fight. Last winter Russia targeted power stations, causing outages, and in July it started targeting port infrastructure to stop the export of Ukrainian grain. Ukraine’s Western allies responded with air defence systems, spare parts and emergency generators to keep Ukraine’s power flowing. They provided medium-range missiles Ukraine combined with its domestically manufactured drones to drive Russian naval power back to its own shores, creating a safe passage for merchant shipping. Ukraine tried its own offensive strategies. It used these ranged weapons to strike deep in the Russian rear to disrupt the supply of weapons to the front, but Russia moved its stockpiles out of range and found delivery byways. Ukraine has sent drones to attack Russian missile manufacturing sites and Moscow itself, but their payloads were too small to do much damage.  Ukraine has most recently asked for F-16 fighter planes, which some NATO members have agreed to supply, but it is doubtful these will be a stalemate-breaker either, say experts. “Even if they get F-16s, they won’t be able to use them effectively because these planes need thousands of hours [of training] in flight to become operational,” Andreas Iliopoulos, a former deputy commander of the Hellenic Army, told Al Jazeera. “They won’t be effective until 2025.” “I think all this is a Ukrainian effort to continue to claim Western help and stave off fatigue and the pressure to negotiate,” said Grivas. Ukraine’s allies banned Russian oil, gold, diamonds, lumber and other lucrative exports to starve the Russian economy, but Russia sold its oil at discounted rates to China, India and other markets. Sanctions also attempted to stop the flow of capital and sensitive technologies to Russia. But Russia has been manufacturing weapons and buying artillery shells and drones from pariah states that share its hatred of the United States – Iran and North Korea. Last August, Ukrainian intelligence estimated Russia had about 585 missiles of various types left, but planned to build more than 100 a month. This month, the Ukrainian military said, Russia had stockpiled more than 800 missiles in Crimea alone and was preparing to fire them. Russia’s ability to keep up its stockpiles and to draw on large reserves of manpower has led some observers to suggest that time is on its side. “Ukraine was likely to lose in a protracted war of attrition, because it would be an unfair fight,” wrote John Mearsheimer, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, in a recent opinion piece entitled “Bound to Lose”. “I keep hearing people say, he’s going to wear out the Ukrainians. That’s not going to happen with a conscript army that doesn’t want to be there,” said Krummrich, who has fought in special operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and believes Russian soldier morale is breaking down. “Every single wave of soldiers that somehow survives and goes home, they’re telling everybody they can, ‘for the love of God, do not get pulled out to Ukraine’,” said Krummrich. Recent reports suggest a growing number of Russian soldiers want to go home.  While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has forsworn any negotiations while Russia sits on Ukrainian soil, Russia has been more nuanced. “Russia has never refused peace talks with Ukraine,” Russian President Vladimir Putin told the Group of 20 on November 21. “Of course, we should think about how to stop this tragedy.” “I think he is messaging again, ‘Hey, I need a way out’. When he got involved in this … he did not have a plan for this situation,” Krummrich said. “I think the secret desire of both is how to get out and who is going to negotiations first,” Grivas said. But is it likely to happen this winter? Both sides are demonstrating a will to fight, for now. Putin may be looking for a symbolic victory ahead of an election next April, and other fissures in the Western alliance, say experts, particularly if former President Donald Trump seems likely to win the US presidential election. “What’s going to happen to the American election … Trump and what the Republicans represent does not help Ukraine, and could potentially make things easier for Russia,” said Krummrich. Congressional Republicans loyal to Trump have led an effort this year to staunch the flow of military aid to Ukraine, saying the US deficit is too high. Even if Ukraine is eventually partitioned, some people believe Russia will suffer a greater loss. “Russia is headed for a big defeat. Its victory would be a catastrophe, because it is being isolated from the rest of Europe, a big blow to its existential core,” said Grivas. “It is being Asianised. The winner is China and the other Eurasian powers, who are able to instrumentalise Russia for the ends of their foreign policies,” he said.           Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'The strikes come as Russia intensifies its attacks in the east and claims to capture the contested village of Khromove. Russian missile strikes have injured 10 people and left several unaccounted for in Donetsk, Ukrainian officials said, as attacks intensify in the embattled eastern region. The overnight shelling hurt 10 people, including four children, in several villages in Donetsk, Ukraine’s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on Thursday. He said a family with two children, as well as two 13-year-olds, were among the injured. “Five more people are being searched for under the rubble,” the minister added. Later, Donetsk authorities said rescuers found one body while four others, including one child, were still under the rubble. An apartment block, nine private houses, a police station, cars and garages were damaged in the villages of Pokrovsk, Novogrodivka and Myrnograd. Klymenko said a police paramedic helped a man with an injured baby get out from under the rubble. The attacks come as Russia steps up the fighting in Donetsk, of which it occupies most parts and says it intends to take over completely. Some of the most intense fighting in recent weeks has been waged in the front-line town of Avdiivka. On Wednesday, Russia said it had captured another contested village in the Donetsk region – Khromove – in what would be a rare advance after weeks of mostly gridlock. Ukrainian officials offered no comment but said Moscow’s forces were suffering heavy losses while launching fierce attacks. Unofficial accounts and bloggers acknowledged that part of the village was held by Russian forces, but dismissed any notion it was fully under Russian control. Ukrainian military spokesperson Oleksandr Shtupun said Russia’s attacks were growing more intense, with air strikes doubling and waves of up to 20 armoured vehicles pushing towards Ukrainian lines. However, he insisted Ukraine was repelling the assaults. Neither Russia nor Ukraine has made significant breakthroughs on the battlefield for weeks as Moscow’s invasion drags into the 22nd month. Ukraine, which has counted on aid and ammunition from Western allies, is pushing its backers to keep up the support amid funding delays from the United States and Europe. “We have to continue, we have to keep fighting. Ukraine is not going to back down,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs, said at a summit of NATO ministers in Brussels on Wednesday. “The issue here is not just Ukraine’s security, it is the security and safety of the entire Euro-Atlantic space.” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, also attending the summit, confirmed NATO would back Ukraine for as long as it takes. “The answer here today at NATO is clear and it’s unwavering. We must and we will continue to support Ukraine,” Blinken said.               Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Visitors would be required to respect Russian values and laws that ensure the country’s national interest. Russia is reported to be preparing to introduce laws that would require foreign visitors to sign a “loyalty agreement”. The interior ministry is preparing the legislation that would bar visitors from criticising Russian policy or discrediting Soviet history. It would also require that they respect traditional Russian family values, culture and environment, state news agency TASS reported on Wednesday. All foreigners would have to sign the pledge, which would, in effect, control what they can say and do while in Russia. This means visitors would be prohibited from “interfering with the activities of public authorities of the Russian Federation, discrediting in any form the foreign and domestic state policy of the Russian Federation, public authorities and their officials,” the report said. For the draft to become law, the document has to be introduced to the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, and to go through committee review and several readings before being submitted to President Vladimir Putin for signing. Officials told state news agency Interfax that the legislation is being worked on by the interior ministry, the government, and the presidential administration and is well advanced. Lieutenant General Valentina Kazakova, head of the ministry’s Main Directorate for Migration, told TASS, “The bill is currently under discussion and will be submitted to the State Duma shortly.” In particular, foreigners would be barred from “distorting the historical truth about the feat of the Soviet people in the defence of the Fatherland and its contribution to the victory over fascism,” the draft bill reads, according to TASS. The triumph over Nazism, under the Soviet leadership of Joseph Stalin, has been constantly compared with Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Putin has utilised this historical moment as an effective tool in his resurgent war on the West and the liberal values mostly associated with it. Even critics and scholars within Russia, who document his totalitarian regime’s atrocities, have lost access to Kremlin-controlled media and are branded “foreign agents”. As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Putin has cast the war as part of an existential battle with the West, saying he will defend Russia’s “sacred” civilisation from what he portrays as the West’s decadence. Under the law, foreigners would have to uphold and abide by “traditional family values”, the “institution of marriage” and “traditional sexual relations”, according to TASS. Russia under President Putin has touted itself as a country home to more conservative moral and family values, backed by the Russian Orthodox Church. To this end, the authorities have cracked down on the LGBTQ community, passing legislation outlawing gender-affirming surgeries and banning “gay propaganda”. Lawmakers, in recent months have also been working on legislation to limit access to reproductive care and abortions as a way of improving the “demographic situation” and countering the low birth rate. “The legislative initiative proposes prohibiting activities that encourage a neglectful attitude toward Russia’s environment or natural resources … Russia’s regional and ethno-cultural diversity [and] traditional Russian moral and spiritual values,” reported TASS. Russia is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world with nearly 200 ethnic groups residing on the territory of the Russian Federation, according to the United Nations. Following the October Revolution in 1917, and the fall of Russia’s imperialist monarchy,\\xa0Stalin embraced Russian nationalism based on the old imperial myth of the greatness of the Russian people, wrote Botakoz Kassymbekova. Bolshevik Moscow made ethnic Russians the most privileged group in the Soviet Union and sent Russian settlers to populate and control non-Russian regions. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, minority groups have accused authorities of using them as fodder for the war. Reports of men being rounded up highlighted the disproportionate impact the war has had on Russians from impoverished regions and ethnic minorities. According to data collected by Russian independent media, a number of areas with high minority populations have suffered the most casualties in the war.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '29 Nov 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': '‘Ukraine is not going to back down’, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tells NATO foreign ministers. Ukraine will forge ahead in the battle against Russia’s invasion, Kyiv’s top diplomat has pledged as he seeks to rally Western support. Ukraine will not “back down” in fighting against the Russian invasion, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a summit of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels on Wednesday, even as its military locked into a bloody stalemate with enemy forces amid signs that the provision of weapons and funding is slowing and that the war in Gaza is limiting global attention. “We have to continue, we have to keep fighting. Ukraine is not going to back down,” Kuleba said. “The issue here is not just Ukraine’s security, it is the security and safety of the entire Euro-Atlantic space.” His entreaty comes amid fears that Western fatigue is setting in over the drawn-out war, and that attention and funding is shifting to the Middle East. The United States, Ukraine’s biggest single-country donor, has sent more than $40bn in aid since Russia’s invasion in February 2022. However, some $61bn in additional aid to Ukraine is being held up by the US Congress. Another $50bn package from the European Union is struggling to pass because of opposition from Hungary, leaving Ukraine concerned about dwindling resources as it heads into the harsh winter. Despite the funding delays, Western leaders insist they will stand by Ukraine as long as it takes. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said “every single NATO member expressed enduring support for Ukraine” at Wednesday’s summit. He added that the US is looking for supplemental funding for Ukraine to be approved by Congress in the coming weeks. As well as funds, Kyiv is in desperate need of ammunition, with the West struggling to keep pace with earlier pledges to supply bullets and shells. The US is engaged in talks with Greece to buy $47m worth of artillery shells for Ukraine, which has urged partners to accelerate the delivery of ammunition. The EU has so far sent Ukraine some 300,000 of the 1 million shells it promised, Kuleba said, but it has warned that it will not be able to meet the target in full. However, Germany’s foreign minister voiced strong backing for redoubling military aid, urging for the formation of a “protective shield” that can block Russian attacks during the winter. The Ukraine-focused NATO summit comes as Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to grind to a winter deadlock 22 months into the war. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said it had fended off a string of overnight Russian drone and missile attacks. The air force said it destroyed nearly two dozen Russian attack drones and several missiles in the nationwide aerial assault. Russian air defence also destroyed a Ukraine-launched drone flying towards Moscow, the mayor of the capital, Sergei Sobyanin, said. Neither Russia nor Ukraine has made significant breakthroughs on the battlefield for weeks as Moscow’s invasion drags on. The conflict has killed or wounded an estimated 500,000 from both sides.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '29 Nov 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Russia is losing manpower at pace, says Ukraine, whose army has been mostly on the defensive in recent days. Russia has tried to smash through Ukraine’s eastern defences before the onset of winter, incurring huge losses during the 92nd week of the war. Between November 22 and 24, Russia unleashed what Ukraine said was the third major attempt to capture Avdiivka in two months, sending about 50 assaults supported by armour. On one day alone, Ukraine’s military said it had “eliminated” 1,100 Russian soldiers and 30 tanks. “There is an average number of eight to 16 to 18 air attacks per day. Sometimes 30. We don’t have time to count them,” Vitaliy Barabash, head of Avdiivka’s military administration, told Channel 24 television. Russian fatalities came to almost 1,000 men a day – 6,260 for the week of November 20-26, said Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Oleksandr Pavlyuk. He said 78 enemy tanks and 113 armoured combat vehicles were also destroyed in the intense fighting By Ukraine’s estimation, more than 325,000 Russian soldiers have died in the war. “The Russians are tolerant to human losses … on the other hand, this tolerance is nestled in a sense of fighting a just war,” Konstantinos Grivas, who teaches geopolitics and weapons systems at the Hellenic Army Academy, told Al Jazeera. “If that doesn’t exist, there is a social reaction … I’m not sure this traditional tolerance will apply in this war, considering also that the population is shrinking. So it will be difficult for Russia to continue to bang its head against the wall indifferent to casualties,” Grivas said. Southern forces spokesman Oleksandr Shtupun said Russian attacks were coming in waves, involving 10-20 people, similar to Ukraine’s platoon or company-sized attacks, suggesting manpower limitations. Shtupun also suggested morale was low, saying Russians were surrendering to Ukrainian forces in increasing numbers – including a dozen on November 15 and some 30 taken prisoner on November 27. Although Ukraine has said its counteroffensive would continue through the winter, its forces seemed to be busy defending from Russian attacks. The only places where Ukraine’s general staff said it was still conducting counteroffensive operations were near Robotyne, on the southern front, where it has breached Russian front-line fortifications, and on the left bank of the Dnipro river, where it has landed reconnaissance troops in force. Russia and Ukraine attacked each other in the air during the week, with Russia unleashing a record 75 Shahed drones against Kyiv on November 25 – Ukraine’s remembrance day for the Holodomor famine of 1932-33. Ukraine’s air force said it downed 74 of them, and a further eight out of nine were launched the following day. Air force spokesperson Yuri Ignat said Russia was painting its drones black and coating them in a radar-absorbent material to make them harder to detect. Ukraine planned to increase its mobile air defence units, consisting of a pick-up truck equipped with a large-calibre machine gun, anti-aircraft gun or Man-Portable Air Defence System (MANPADS). These, Ignat said, had downed a large proportion of the drones. Russia seemed to be pursuing a hybrid war through non-military means as well. Finland on Friday closed three border crossings to Russia for a month, saying Moscow was deliberately sending asylum-seekers to create a refugee crisis. Some 900 nationals from Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen had entered Finland this month, said the Finnish Border Guard, compared with about one asylum seeker a day previously. “Intelligence information from different sources tells us that there still are people on the move … If this continues, more measures will be announced in the near future,” Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said on Monday. Finland had already closed four border crossings to Russia, and has threatened to close the remaining one – at Raja-Jooseppi, in the Arctic. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, accused Finland of stoking “Russophobia”, but other Nordic countries have followed developments with similar concern. Latvia and Estonia said they, too, had observed an increase of asylum seekers in what Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur described as an attempt to “weaponise illegal immigration”. Both countries were considering closing their borders with Russia, as was Norwegian Prime Minister Johan Gahr Store. Some European Union members were at risk of closing their borders to Ukraine for a different reason. Slovak truckers threatened to blockade their country’s main border crossing to Ukraine beginning on December 1, if the EU didn’t limit competition from Ukrainian truckers. They were following the lead of Polish truckers, who started similar protests earlier this month and had, the previous day, blockaded a major crossing with Ukraine, creating traffic queues kilometres long. Truckers from both countries say Ukrainian hauliers are undercutting their rates and want the EU to bring back a permit system for non-EU truckers. Earlier in the year, Poland and Hungary threatened to stop the transit of Ukrainian grain through their territories if the grain was also sold in-country. They said the dumping of relatively cheap Ukrainian grain was threatening to put their farmers out of business. Both of these commercial disputes are suggestive of the problems EU leaders are likely facing in the run-up to a December summit when there will be pressure to declare Ukraine an official EU candidate. That is one of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s three declared wishes – a move that would send a powerful political signal that Europe is prepared to defend Ukraine in the long run. Zelenskyy also listed as key “victories” US Congressional approval of a $60bn military aid package and EU approval of a 19 billion euro ($21bn) military aid package, both for 2024. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already put his own military budget in place. On November 27 he signed a 70 percent increase of defence and security spending next year, to $157.5bn. Defence and security will thus represent some 39 percent of the entire Russian budget of $412bn – itself 13 percent higher than last year’s budget.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Ukrainian officials say wife of Kyrylo Budanov has been hospitalised due to heavy metals poisoning. The wife of Ukraine’s military spy chief has been poisoned with heavy metals and is undergoing treatment, a Ukrainian official says. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian military intelligence agency, or GUR, said Marianna Budanova, wife of Kyrylo Budanov, was receiving treatment in hospital. “Yes, I can confirm the information. Unfortunately, it is true,” GUR spokesperson Andriy Yusov told the Reuters news agency on Tuesday without clarifying when the poisoning occurred or who was responsible. Budanov has become a celebrated figure in Ukraine for his role in planning clandestine operations against Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.      Yusov said this year that Budanov had survived 10 assassination attempts by Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB. While it is not immediately clear who was behind the suspected poisoning of his wife, the BBC’s Ukrainian service cited Yusov as saying that other GUR officials have experienced milder poisoning symptoms. The suspected poisoning was first reported by Ukrainian media. There was no immediate comment from Russian authorities. Russian media figures have speculated that the poisoning could be a result of infighting within Ukraine. Russia has previously been accused of poisoning dissidents, including politician Alexey Navalny and two Russian exiles who attended a summit in Berlin organised by a critic of Russia. Moscow has also blamed Ukraine for suspected involvement in the killings of a pro-war Russian blogger and a pro-war journalist on Russian soil, something Ukraine denies.

       "  'Text': \"Ministers of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania say presence of Sergey Lavrov risks legitimising Russian war in Ukraine. The foreign ministers of three Baltic states have announced that they will boycott a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was invited to the event. In a statement on Tuesday, the officials from Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania said that a decision to invite Lavrov to attend the summit in Skopje risked legitimising Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “We deeply regret the decision enabling the personal participation of Russian Foreign Minister S. Lavrov at the 30th Session of the OSCE Ministerial Council in Skopje,” the statement reads. “It will only provide Russia with yet another propaganda opportunity.” Separately, Oleh Nikolenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian foreign ministry, wrote in a statement on Facebook that the Ukrainian delegation would not take part in the meeting. Nikolenko said Russia had abused the rules of consensus in the organisation, resorted to “blackmail and open threats” and had also been holding three Ukrainian OSCE representatives in prison for 500 days. “In such conditions, the presence of a Russian delegation … at minister-level for the first time since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine will only deepen the crisis into which Russia has driven the OSCE,” he said. There was no immediate comment from the Russian foreign ministry.

Speaking before a gathering of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg urged members to “stay the course” in their support for Ukraine, as both the United States and European Union struggle to agree on further military aid. The OSCE, a 57-member organisation first started during the Cold War with the goal of lowering tensions between East and West, has a rotating presidency currently held by North Macedonia, whose foreign minister invited Lavrov to the summit that is set to begin on Thursday. Lavrov said on Monday that he would attend, in what would be his first trip to a NATO member since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Speaking to reporters at NATO headquarters on Tuesday, North Macedonia’s Foreign Minister Bujar Osmani defended the decision and argued that the OSCE should be seen as a neutral forum.      “Lavrov is not coming to Skopje, in a way. Lavrov is coming to the OSCE just as he went to [the] UN in New York a few months ago,” Osmani said. “I won’t be meeting him as the foreign minister of North Macedonia, but as the OSCE chairman in office.” However, Osmani also took a firm stance on Ukraine, saying that he would tell Lavrov that “we have turned [the] OSCE into a platform for political and legal accountability of the Russian Federation for its deeds in Ukraine, and we will continue to do so”.

       "  'Text': 'Jens Stoltenberg meets alliance’s top diplomats amid some resistance in US, Europe to keep funding war against Russia. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has urged members of the security alliance to continue backing Ukraine in its battle against Russia’s invasion amid opposition in the United States to a military aid package and resistance in Europe for a longer-term support plan for Kyiv. “We just have to stay the course. This is also about our security interests,” Secretary General Stoltenberg said on Tuesday at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. The US has provided more than $40bn in security aid to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and pledged to back Kyiv for as long as necessary. But some $61bn in proposed US aid to Ukraine is being held up by the US Congress, while another $50bn package from the European Union is struggling to pass because of opposition from Hungary. Al Jazeera’s Step Vaessen, reporting from Brussels, said the funding delays show indications of “fatigue” from some NATO members 21 months into the war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the two-day summit was aimed at “strongly reaffirming our support for Ukraine as it continues to face Russia’s war of aggression”. “I’m confident that the United States will continue to provide support because it is in the security interest of the United States to do so and it’s also in line with what we have agreed,” Stoltenberg said. \\xa0      Stoltenberg pointed to recent pledges from Germany and the Netherlands worth 10 billion euros ($11bn) as proof that NATO remained committed to backing Kyiv. “Even though the frontline has not moved so much, the Ukrainians have been able to inflict heavy losses on the Russian forces,” he said. Concerns have ratcheted up over the future of Western backing for Ukraine as Kyiv’s top general has admitted that the fierce fighting has reached a “stalemate“. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba will try to overcome such fatigue and lobby for continued NATO backing when he joins the summit on Wednesday. Kuleba will also work with NATO ministers to outline a plan for reforms aimed at helping Ukraine gain eventual membership in the alliance. Russia has said NATO expansionism is at the core of its grudge against bordering Ukraine, which it has repeatedly warned not to join the alliance. More than 500,000 troops from Russia and Ukraine are estimated to have been killed or wounded since Moscow marched troops across its neighbour’s border in February 2022. At least 10,000 civilians have also been killed in the conflict, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has said. The ministers planned to discuss Russia’s “destabilising actions” throughout the region, including allegations it has been enabling undocumented migrants to reach neighbouring Finland. Finland on Tuesday announced that it will close its entire border with Russia to travellers for the next two weeks in a bid to halt the unusually large flow of asylum seekers to the Nordic nation, which the government and its allies called an orchestrated move by Moscow.      The ministers are likely to address the seven-week war between Israel and Hamas, though it is not officially on the agenda. Al Jazeera’s Vaessen said the ministers would discuss “not only the extension of the ceasefire [between Israel and Hamas] but a future for Gaza after the war is finished”. On China, Stoltenberg said: “China is not an adversary, but at the same, we must be clear-eyed about the impact of China’s coercive policies on our security.” Hanging in the background is the membership status of Sweden, which has been awaiting ratification from Turkey and Hungary for 18 months. Stoltenberg on Tuesday told Hungarian media he expected the two countries to approve Sweden’s membership bid without further delay, but gave no precise timeline. The Turkish parliament started this month to debate Sweden’s bid to join after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched the process following a deal at a NATO summit in July, but the legislature’s foreign affairs commission decided to delay the vote after lawmakers expressed reservations. Turkey has demanded that Sweden take more steps to rein in local members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a “terrorist” group by Ankara, the EU and the US. Sweden and Finland requested to join NATO in May last year following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In order to join, a country must be approved by all current members. While Finland’s accession was approved in April, Turkey and Hungary have yet to approve Sweden’s application for membership.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Worsening weather in Odesa, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Kyiv has put pressure on emergency services, already overstretched by war. Ten people have died in Ukraine as icy storms of snow and rain swept in from the Black Sea, crippling infrastructure, blocking roads and cutting power, the country’s interior minister said. The record-breaking storm has lashed swathes of the country since Sunday, leaving thousands of settlements in the affected region without power and taxing an already overworked energy grid and rescue service overextended by Russia’s nearly two-year invasion. “As a result of worsening weather conditions, 10 people died in Odesa, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Kyiv regions,” Minister Ihor Klymenko wrote on the Telegram app on Tuesday. “Twenty-three people were injured, including two children.” A total of 411 settlements in 11 regions had lost power, and more than 1,500 vehicles had to be rescued, Klymenko said. Emergency responders carried out rescues and evacuations of residents swept off roads and trapped by snow. Southern Ukraine was the worst affected, particularly the Black Sea region of Odesa. Cars and buses slid off frozen roads into fields and police battled high winds to tow the vehicles out. Oleh Kiper, the governor of the Odesa region where five people died due to the weather, said nearly 2,500 people had been rescued by emergency services after becoming trapped by the snow. “849 vehicles have been towed out, including 24 buses and 17 ambulances,” Kiper wrote on Telegram, adding that over 300 settlements in his region were without power. The extreme weather struck as tens of thousands of troops man front-line positions in the 21-month-old war with Russia amid fears Moscow could attack the power grid with air strikes this winter. The storm system overran also nearby regions. In Russian-annexed Crimea and southern Russia, at least three people were reported to have died. Russia’s Ministry of Energy said “about 1.9 million people” were affected by power cuts in the southern Russian regions of Dagestan, Krasnodar and Rostov as well as the occupied Ukrainian territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhia and Crimea.

More than half a million people are without power in occupied-Crimea, Russia and Ukraine after a storm in the Black Sea region flooded roads, ripped up trees and took down power lines, according to Russian state media and Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy. More than 2,000 towns and villages were without electricity on Sunday night and Monday morning in 16 Ukrainian regions, including Odesa, Mykolaiv and inland in Kyiv, as trees were uprooted, power lines snapped and electrical substations failed, leaving almost 150,000 households in the area without electricity, Ukraine’s Energy Ministry said. A 110-metre (360ft) chimney of a heat and power plant collapsed in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Sunday night, adding to Ukraine’s losses of energy infrastructure that have already sustained heavy damage from Moscow’s military campaign targeting Ukraine’s power grid. As winter nears, Russia has been attacking civilian infrastructure far from the front lines, leaving millions of Ukrainians without power, heat and water for days at a time. Although the heating supply has been restored after plants in Odesa were shut down for several hours due to power fluctuations, Ukrainian officials said they expected the weather to worsen as forecasters predicted more strong winds and snowfall. The head of Russia’s national meteorological service said the storm that hit Crimea was the most powerful since record-keeping began, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. At least three people were killed during the storm, local media reported. One person was killed in the resort city of Sochi, another on the Russian-held Crimean Peninsula and a third person on board a vessel in the Kerch Strait, which separates Crimea from the Russian mainland, the state news agency TASS reported. Russia’s Ministry of Energy said “about 1.9 million people” were affected by power cuts in the southern Russian regions of Dagestan, Krasnodar and Rostov as well as the occupied Ukrainian territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhia and Crimea. Crimea’s Moscow-appointed governor declared a state of emergency, and hundreds of people were evacuated. A video published online showed large waves sweeping over the seafront in Sochi and carrying away cars. In the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, an aquarium flooded and nearly 800 exotic fish, including pikes and piranhas, died from thermal shock as cold seawater flooded the facility, the aquarium director said. Roman Vilfand, the head of Russia’s national meteorological service, said a similar storm hit the region in November 1854 during the Crimean War. It caused at least 30 ships to sink off Crimea’s coast, RIA Novosti said. In southern Russia, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium stopped crude oil loading at the Novorossiysk port on Monday due to “extremely unfavorable weather conditions”, including winds of up to 86 kilometres per hour (54 miles per hour) and waves up to 8 metres (26ft) high.

       "  'Date': '27 Nov 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Russia has put the communications director of social media company Meta on a wanted list, it has been revealed, amid Moscow’s announcement of new media restrictions ahead of next year’s presidential election. Andy Stone, a spokesperson of US tech giant Meta Platforms Inc, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, is wanted on unspecified criminal charges, Russian news wires reported late on Sunday, referring to an Interior Ministry database. Russia added Meta to its list of “terrorists and extremist” organisations last year. The list includes right-wing nationalist groups; foreign “terrorist organisations,” including the Taliban; and Russian opposition groups. The classification means Russians using Facebook and Instagram could face possible criminal charges. According to Mediazona, an independent news website that covers Russia’s opposition and prison system, Stone was put on the wanted list in February 2022, but authorities made no related statements at the time and no news media reported on the matter until this week. In April 2022, Russia also formally barred Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg from entering the country. Russia’s row with Meta started with its invasion of Ukraine, as users from both sides of the war voiced their unfiltered emotions on the platforms. Stone, at that time, announced temporary changes to Meta’s hate speech policy to allow for “forms of political expression that would normally violate [its] rules, like violent speech such as ‘death to the Russian invaders’”. In the same statement, Stone added that “credible calls for violence against Russian civilians” would remain banned. In late March, Russia banned Facebook and Instagram for “carrying out extremist activities” after authorities accused Meta of tolerating “Russophobia”. Facebook and Instagram have been inaccessible in Russia since, but many Russians resorted to using VPNs to keep using the social media networks. Instagram is particularly popular in Russia and is an important platform for advertisement and sales. Earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin\\xa0approved changes to a law that will curtail media coverage of next year’s presidential election, according to local news agencies. To enforce this ban, the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media also reportedly plans to block certain virtual private networks (VPNs) that Russians widely use to bypass internet restrictions.

Russian air defences have intercepted Ukrainian drones over several regions inside its territory, including Moscow, just a day after Kyiv reported the “largest drone attack” on Ukraine since Moscow invaded the country in February last year. “Air defence destroyed four Ukrainian drones over the territory of the Bryansk, Smolensk and Tula regions,” Russia’s Ministry of Defence\\xa0said in a statement on Sunday. Earlier, Russia said some drones were shot down over the Moscow region. The Russian army said it had also downed two Ukrainian missiles headed for Russia over the Sea of Azov, between the two countries. Ukraine, meanwhile, said its air defence had downed eight out of nine drones over the country on Sunday. On Saturday, Ukraine said Moscow had launched 75 drones into the country, mostly aimed at the capital. The attack came as Kyiv marked Holodomor, the Soviet-engineered starvation tragedy that killed millions of Ukrainians during the Stalin era. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attack an act of “willful terror”, saying “the Russian leadership is proud of the fact that it can kill”. Ukraine has hit Russian regions and the annexed Crimean Peninsula with drones for months, launching a counteroffensive this summer to push back Russian forces. Russia annexed Crimea and backed separatists in eastern Ukraine after the pro-Moscow government of President Viktor Yanukovych was overthrown following a popular uprising in 2014.

       "  'Text': 'Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attack an act of ‘wilful terror’. At least five people were wounded after Russia fired more than 70 drones at Kyiv overnight, Ukrainian officials said, calling it the largest drone attack in the war so far. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attack on the capital an act of “wilful terror”, writing on the Telegram app that “the Russian leadership is proud of the fact that it can kill”. The attack, which used Iranian-designed Shahed kamikaze drones, reportedly began hitting different districts of Kyiv in the early hours of Saturday, with more waves coming as the sun rose. The air raid warning lasted for six hours. Air force chief Mykola Oleschuk said 71 of the 75 drones launched at Ukraine had been downed. He praised the effectiveness of “mobile fire” units – usually fast pick-up trucks with a machine gun or flak cannon mounted on their flatbed. According to Oleschuk, these downed nearly 40 percent of the drones. Kyiv’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko, writing on Telegram, said the attack had injured five people, including an 11-year-old girl, and damaged buildings in districts all across the city. Fragments from a downed drone had started a fire in a children’s nursery, he said.      The target of the attack was not immediately clear, but Ukraine has warned in recent weeks that Russia will once again wage an aerial campaign to destroy Ukraine’s energy system. Ukraine’s energy ministry said nearly 200 buildings in the capital, including 77 residential ones, had been left without power as a result of the attack. Ukraine’s air force said the raid was Russia’s largest drone attack since the beginning of the war in February 2022. Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from Kyiv, said Russian forces are trying to destroy critical infrastructure in Ukraine ahead of winter. “That is the concern for residents here in Kyiv and other cities as Russia targets important infrastructure and power supply as they did last year,” he said. Kyiv has also ramped up drone and missile attacks on Russian military installations in eastern Ukraine and in and around the Crimean peninsula as it presses a counteroffensive it launched in June. Russian missile defences were reported to have downed 13 Ukrainian drones over Crimea and three more over the Volgograd region in the early hours of Friday, local media said, citing Russia’s defence ministry. Zelenskyy said on Friday that Ukraine needed to secure three key “victories” abroad, including the approval of extensive aid packages from the United States Congress and the European Union, and a formal start of accession talks to join the European Union. Twenty months into Russia’s full-scale invasion, fatigue has crept into the West’s relations with Kyiv, which heavily relies on its allies for military, economic and humanitarian aid to battle against the Kremlin’s troops.

       "  'Text': 'Russian theatre says actress\\xa0Polina Menshikh died on stage in the\\xa0Donbas\\xa0region in a Ukrainian air raid. A Russian actress has been killed by a Ukrainian air attack while performing for Russian troops in eastern Ukraine. The Russian theatre for which Polina Menshikh, 40, worked confirmed that she was killed while performing on stage in the Donbas region. The details of the incident could not be independently verified, but military officials on both sides confirmed there had been a Ukrainian attack in the area on November 19. A Russian military investigator, quoted by Russian state television, said a school and cultural centre had been hit by HIMARS missiles in a village in the Donetsk region referred to as Kumachovo and known by Ukrainians as Kumachove, 60km (37 miles) from the front line. The investigator said one civilian, of whom he gave no further details, had been killed but made no mention of military casualties. The Russian defence ministry declined to comment and has mentioned no casualties from the attack. Ukrainian commanders said their forces had struck a Russian military award ceremony, targeting Russia’s 810th Separate Naval Infantry Brigade.      Robert Brovdi, a Ukrainian military commander, said in a post on social media that 25 people had been killed in the strike and more than 100 wounded. Unverified video footage on pro-Russian Telegram channels showed soldiers watching Menshikh singing on stage with a guitar on the day the Russian military celebrated their missile and artillery forces. Mid-song, the building was suddenly rocked by a blast and windows can be heard shattering before the lights go out and someone is caught on camera using an expletive. Ukraine’s Brovdi said the attack was “revenge for the 128th,” a reference to a Russian attack this month on soldiers from Ukraine’s 128th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade, in which the brigade said 19 of its soldiers were killed. Russian cultural leaders have been urged to visit areas near the front line to show support for soldiers fighting in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin sent troops to invade in February 2022. Ukraine has ramped up drone and missile attacks on Russian military installations in eastern Ukraine and in and around the Crimean peninsula as it presses a counteroffensive launched in June.

       "  'Text': 'Putin says world should try and stop ‘tragedy’ in Gaza as Russian forces reportedly kill civilians in Ukraine’s Kherson. Russian President Vladimir Putin reacted to criticism of his war in Ukraine from the world’s wealthiest nations, now in its 91st week, by holding up Israel’s war in Gaza for comparison. “I understand that this war, and the death of people, cannot but shock,” Putin told the virtual G20 meeting called by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday [November 21]. “And the extermination of the civilian population in Palestine in the Gaza Strip today, is not shocking?” Putin asked. Russia has leveraged the deaths of more than 14,500 civilians in Gaza to cast its own aggression in Ukraine in a more favourable light. Putin’s remarks came after a series of speeches from other leaders expressing shock at Russian aggression. “Yes, of course, military actions are always a tragedy,” Putin said. “And of course, we should think about how to stop this tragedy.” Some observers took this remark to be conciliatory, and Putin reminded his colleagues that “Russia has never refused peace talks with Ukraine,” whereas Ukraine refuses peace talks with Russia under the current government. But only the previous day his ambassador at large, Rodion Miroshnik, told reporters in Moscow that “the current regime [in Kyiv] is absolutely toxic, we do not see any options for co-existence with it at the moment.” Putin’s opposition to war was also cast into doubt by domestic developments. A St Petersburg court sentenced Russian artist Alexandra Skochilenko to seven years’ imprisonment for “spreading false information” on November 17, after she replaced five supermarket price tags with messages against the war. “The Russian army bombed an arts school in Mariupol. Some 400 people were hiding in it from the shelling,” one read. Another said, “Russian conscripts are being sent to Ukraine. Lives of our children are the price of this war.” A Russian wartime law criminalises criticism of Putin’s prosecution of the invasion, and any view that deviates from the Kremlin’s position. Skochilenko wept in the dock as her sentence was read out. The prosecutor had asked for eight years. “How weak is our prosecutor’s faith in our state and society if he thinks our statehood and public safety can be ruined by five little pieces of paper?” she said in court. “Everyone sees and knows that you are not judging a terrorist. You’re not trying an extremist. You’re not even trying a political activist. You’re judging a pacifist.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said troops were still launching counteroffensive actions on the southern front in the 91st week of the war, but had gone on the defensive in the east. He attributed the defensive posture to winter weather, rather than a series of attacks Russian troops have launched in Avdiivka, Bakhmut, Kupiansk and Mariivka in recent weeks. “Difficult weather, difficult defence on the Lyman, Bakhmut, Donetsk and Avdiivka fronts. Offensive actions in the south,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram on Wednesday. Even in the south, however, a Ukrainian counteroffensive that began in June has failed to make territorial gains for the past few weeks. There was one bright spot for Ukraine on the front lines. Ukraine’s general staff said on November 17 their marines had established a bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson, killing a battalion’s worth of Russian soldiers – some 1,200 men – and destroying two dozen tanks and four dozen armoured vehicles. The figures were possibly cumulative for the entire period of this bridgehead action, which started approximately a month ago, when a Russian reporter said Ukrainian reconnaissance units had reached the outskirts of Krynky, 20km (12.4 miles) east of Kherson City on the left bank. Ukraine general staff said, “One of the main goals of this work is to push the enemy as far as possible from the right bank in order to secure the civilian population from continuous Russian shelling.” Russian artillery killed two civilians in a parking lot in Kherson City on Monday, Ukrainian authorities said. Despite Russia’s difficulty in reinforcing its thin defences on this far western corner of the front, Ukraine has had difficulty getting on. The staff said Russian defences in the area were “fairly elaborate”. A Ukrainian soldier told the Wall Street Journal they consisted of “elaborate dugouts that [Russian forces] constructed over months”. The strength of these could weaken over winter, said the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, a think tank. “Russian forces have not constructed extensive visible defensive fortifications … and appear to have opted for more discrete fortifications set further from the frontline,” the ISW wrote. “The discrete fortifications located away from the frontline in Kherson Oblast will likely only be fully effective if they remain concealed, however. Fall and winter weather conditions may reveal some concealed positions as foliage and natural ground cover die.” Russian sources provided contradictory accounts about this Ukrainian action. Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu told the Russian Ministry of Defence Collegium on November 21, that “all attempts of the Ukrainian armed forces to conduct an amphibious operation in the Kherson direction were unsuccessful,” while “suffering colossal losses”. But on the same day, a Russian military reporter contradicted the official version, saying Ukrainian forces gunned down an entire Russian assault group near Krynky. “If the company craps itself and leaves the village, there is no point in reporting that it is ‘ours’,” wrote the reporter in a diatribe against official reports that gloss over bad news. Russia scored more success by intensifying its attacks on the softer target of Ukrainian energy infrastructure – a repeat of last winter’s tactic. Russia reportedly sent a total of 96 Iranian-designed Shahed drones into Ukrainian civilian territory during the week in attacks almost every night. Some of the attacks were accompanied by missiles. The worst came on the night of November 17-18, when Ukraine said it downed 29 out of 38 drones. But the rest caused power outages in 400 towns and villages in the south and north of the country. “Your accuracy, guys, is literally life for Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the air force, but warned: “The closer we are to winter, the more Russians will try to make the strikes more powerful.” Ukrainian authorities said among the drones they shot down on November 21 was an Iranian-built Mohajer-6. Unlike the Shahed, the Mohajer is not a kamikaze drone. It is designed for reconnaissance and attack, and can carry four missiles. The recurrence of Russia’s winter tactics was likely the motive for Berlin upping the number of IRIS-T air defence systems it promised to supply Ukraine from eight to 12, in a new $1.3bn defence aid package on November 21. But the systems still have to be built, and capacity is low – only three of the eight previously pledged systems have been delivered, and those took a year. Separately, a border crisis brewed. Finland said it was preparing to shut all but one of its eight border crossings with Russia on November 22. Four were shut on November 17 after a surge of refugee arrivals – more than 600 in November, compared with dozens a month before that. “Russia is effectively instrumentalising people, not only letting people through to the Finnish border with invalid documents or missing documents, which has not been the case before, but also we have evidence that Russia is effectively bringing those people to the border and organizing transport as well,” foreign minister Elina Valtonen told Reuters on November 21. She described it as part of Russia’s “hybrid warfare” against Finland. “At the EU border with Finland, Russian border guards have been letting people through without Schengen visas or EU residence permits. People who are being misled. People who are being used by Russia,” EU commissioner for home affairs Ylva Johansson said on November 21. In 2021, Russia’s main ally Belarus attempted to instrumentalise refugees, bringing in thousands of Syrians and Iraqis by plane from Istanbul, Amman and elsewhere and ferrying them to the borders with Poland and Lithuania.

       "  'Date': '23 Nov 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'It might help Iran bolster military ties with Russia but could hurt efforts to patch up relations with the European Union. Tehran, Iran – The United States has renewed its warnings that Iran may be preparing to provide Russia with advanced ballistic missiles for use in the war in Ukraine. The latest assertion by the White House comes as Iran has not publicly shifted its position on the war but has recently been freed of some United Nations limitations on its military programme. So is it actually likely Iran will provide Russia with missiles? What are the factors at play, and how does this shape the growing hostilities between Iran and the West during the war on Gaza? White House security spokesman John Kirby said on Tuesday: “Iran may be preparing to go a step further in its support for Russia” by providing Moscow with ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine. He alleged that in return for that support, Russia has offered Tehran “unprecedented defence cooperation”, including electronics and air defence. Iran wants to buy billions of dollars of military equipment from Russia, including attack helicopters, radar systems and combat trainer aircraft on top of the advanced Su-35 fighter jets it has publicly said it wishes to buy, Kirby said. Western governments said Iran has been supplying Russia with hundreds of so-called kamikaze drones that have been used in the war and have imposed many rounds of sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities in response. Kirby said in June that Iran is also providing material support to build a drone manufacturing plant in Russia. On Tuesday, he said Iran has given Russia guided aerial bombs and artillery munitions as well. Washington has repeatedly warned of Tehran supplying missiles to Moscow and has been met with the same Iranian response each time. Tehran’s official stance on the war has consisted of saying its roots are in NATO’s unchecked expansion, it wants the war to end through dialogue and it supplied Moscow with drones as part of bilateral defence cooperation but months before the war began. From a purely military standpoint, it would make sense for Iran to provide Russia with precision-guided ballistic missiles, according to Fabian Hinz, a military analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “The Russians have their own weapons in this category, but they just don’t have enough as Russia and Ukraine alike have a problem with mass, and they need enormous quantities. Precision-guided munitions are always in short supply, so the more you can get the better,” he told Al Jazeera. Hinz said it is still unclear how likely it is for Iran to actually provide the missiles, which would signal a significant chapter in military cooperation, and why it hasn’t happened yet. Political reluctance on either side or even potential legal challenges could be playing a role. Last month, a number of UN restrictions on Iran’s missile programme expired as part of the country’s comatose 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Prior to that, Western parties to the accord regularly asserted that Iran was violating the UN resolution underpinning the nuclear deal by arming Russia, something Tehran dismissed. Now that barrier is gone as well. Hinz said that beyond expanding its all-around relations with Russia, Iran has considerable incentives to boost its military cooperation, including receiving Russian money and military technology. “Iran’s and Russia’s arms industries are somewhat complementary. The Russians, for example, have pretty decent fighter jets, which is something the Iranians can’t produce. And the Iranians, in turn, have mass-production capability for various precision-guided munitions and suicide drones that could help Russia in the war in Ukraine,” the analyst said. Iran has showed its Ababil and Fateh missiles to Russian officials, including at an exhibition in Moscow in August and another in Tehran in September, which Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu attended. The Ababil ballistic missile is a tactical weapon with medium range whereas the array of missiles that fall under the Fateh category are varied and include projectiles with a relatively long range of more than 700km (435 miles), Hinz said. “These are solid-propellant, precision-guided systems that have been proven to be very very accurate when used by the Iranians. So they are reliable, potent systems that would be useful to the Russians and would cover quite a bit of Ukraine,” the analyst said but pointed out that Russia would also require precise intelligence if it seeks to strike targets deep inside Ukraine. The US has been saying for almost a year that Iran may be preparing to give Russia missiles, but there has yet to be a major policy change on the part of Tehran, according to Abdolrasool Divsallar, an adjunct professor at the Milan-based Universita Cattolica. “I think on the Iranian side, the calculus is that such a capability should be sent to the Russians in case they can provide Iran with more effective weapons, and I think the Russians have not yet done that, as we have seen in the case of the Su-35s,” he told Al Jazeera. Divsallar said Iran is now diplomatically engaged with European actors on Israel’s war on Gaza and would not want to escalate its gradually rising tensions with the European Union now. “Providing offensive capabilities to Russia will exactly cause that escalation, and the Iranians don’t want that at this moment,” he said. Iran may be using military visits with Russian officials to showcase its military assets and also as sort of a “bargaining process” to persuade Moscow to provide it with more advanced arms, the analyst believes. “So my assessment is that this is not going to take place now. There are both political reasons – on the EU-Iran level –and strategic reasons between Russia and Iran that are not in favour of such a decision. Besides, previous rejections by Persian Gulf states of such a thing and Russia’s concerns regarding such rejections and its implications for Iran-Saudi relations are all factors that remain unchanged.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'The Kremlin says only that it is ‘developing military relations’ with Iran as Ukraine reports ‘rare’ drone. Russia has declined to comment on US claims that Iran could supply it with ballistic missiles. Ukraine said it shot down a “rare” Iran-built drone amid a barrage of attacks overnight. The Ukrainian Air Force said on Wednesday that it had downed more than a dozen attack drones and a cruise missile. The overnight assault followed a report by authorities in the southern region of Odesa that a rare Iranian-designed attack and reconnaissance drone had been destroyed. The air force said the overnight barrage was launched from southeast Russia and that a combination of air defence units in several central regions had “destroyed all 14 enemy Shahed-131/136 drones”. “The X-22 cruise missile failed to reach its target and landed in Zaporizhia region in an open area, and the blast wave damaged private homes. There were no casualties,” it added in a statement. Ukraine has been bracing for an increase in Russian attacks on critical infrastructure – particularly energy facilities – as subzero temperatures set in. Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure last winter left many in the cold and dark for long periods. Kyiv has since received more air defence systems from its allies. Authorities in the Odesa region said on Tuesday that they had downed a “rare” Mohajer-6 drone. “The reconnaissance and strike UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] was sneaking up on the Odesa region,” city officials said. The statement on social media said Russia had purchased 30 of the drones last year and that air defence forces shot one down for the first time last September. The Mohajer-6 is designed for reconnaissance and attack, can carry four guided missiles and has a range of up to 200km (124 miles) over 12 hours, the statement added. Iran’s support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has long disturbed the US. The Kremlin declined on Wednesday to comment on a suggestion by White House spokesperson John Kirby that Iran may be considering providing Russia with ballistic missiles for use in its war. “We are developing relations with Iran, including in the field of military-technical cooperation, but we do not comment on this information,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about the accusation.

       "  'Text': 'Unable to navigate foreign health systems and disappointed by the level of care, some refugees risk it all for the sake of their babies. Tamara Zaiva, a 35-year-old veterinarian, fled Ukraine when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. She travelled with her five-year-old son and settled in Poland, where her husband worked. But 18 months later, and 22 weeks pregnant, Zaiva travelled back to Odesa despite the risks so that she could give birth in her homeland. “Because her new life depended on it,” said Zaiva, clutching her newborn girl, who stirred momentarily before dozing off again on her shoulder. Due to a misunderstanding caused by language barriers, she thought her daughter had Down’s syndrome, and feared that she would be unable to afford expensive testing. “I really wanted to go home to see my doctor,” she said. Her baby was born five months ago at a hospital in Ukraine’s southwest, weighing 3.3kg at 40 weeks. Zaiva said she decided to return to her war-torn country from the Polish port city Gdynia because she did not have help in navigating a health system that felt foreign to her. Her son recently started school in Ukraine. Nevertheless, Zaiva keeps the children’s passports close to hand, in case they need to flee again. Anna, 30, a teacher from Kyiv, also travelled back from Poland to give birth. She had fled the war in the early days of her pregnancy “because I understood that it’s not safe in Ukraine”. But she found patient waiting times in Poland were long and said the level of care was insufficient. “It was very difficult,” she said. She is due in January. “If the (safety) situation changes, I will think about going abroad with the newborn.” The two women are among hundreds who have returned to wartime Ukraine while pregnant, citing shortcomings in maternity care in host countries, according to local NGOs and research by the New York-headquartered Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR). “Because of the barriers that women face in these countries, it’s often easier for them to go back to Ukraine,” Leah Hoctor, CRR’s European leader, told Al Jazeera. Some reasons are specific to refugees, such as language barriers and information shortfalls, while others are structural, including a lack of resources or funds. “Many of the interviewees pointed out that the standard of care was much lower (than in Ukraine),” said Hoctor. In all four countries CRR studied – Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Poland – NGOs have stepped up to help women. “It’s really easy to get lost in this system, refugees are expected to know their way without orientation,” said Anna Ivanyi, from Emma, a women’s association in Hungary. Emma volunteers accompany women to their appointments, sometimes to protect Ukrainians from “the hostility” of institutions. Even though healthcare for refugees is state-funded, some doctors demand payment or refuse to treat Ukrainians, said Carmen Radu, advocacy officer at the Romanian Independent Midwives Association. She estimated that hundreds of Ukrainian women have left Romania to return, since Russia’s war began. According to Malgorzata Kolaczek, vice-president of Foundation Towards Dialogue, a Polish NGO working with Roma refugees from Ukraine, hundreds of pregnant women have also left Poland. Across Europe, members of Roma communities are heavily persecuted. When Russia’s war began, Roma refugees from Ukraine recounted episodes of discrimination during their perilous journeys to safety. “I don’t think that Poland wants to encourage them to stay here to be honest,” said Kolaczek. “Compared to some (of these) countries, we have a well-developed system of gynaecologists and family doctors,” said Galina Maistruk, a gynaecologist who heads the Women Health and Family Planning (WHFP), the Ukrainian partner of the International Planned Parenthood foundation. “Even during the war, this system didn’t crash,” she said. The Kyiv-based organisation has provided medical equipment to maternity clinics around the country, including three hospitals in Mariupol, a city now occupied by Russia. In March 2022, Russia bombed a maternity ward in Mariupol, killing at least three people. Doctors at Kyiv’s Maternity Hospital No. 1 are busy preparing for winter. Last year, doctors and nurses lived at the hospital for 40 days, melting snow for water during blackouts, said Oleksandra Lysenko, vice director of the hospital. “Still, everything was clean,” she said. Now, the hospital has its own water resources, two power generators and a fully-equipped bomb shelter. But there is no cure for anxiety. Lysenko, wearing a lab coat decorated with blue and pink birds, joked that she treats her insomnia with a sip of beer each night. “Ukrainians are in great psychological shock,” said WHFP’s Maistruk. “And doctors say that there are a lot of complications.” According to several studies, miscarriages and pregnancy complications rise during conflict. “We have seen an increase in the number of premature births and complicated pregnancies,” said Liudmila Ivanova, a gynaecologist in central Ukraine. About 40 percent of her patients left at the start of the war, but many still consult her by phone. Once, she took part in a birth, at a Dutch hospital, via Zoom. According to her, all women experience gynaecological issues due to the stress of war.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

More than 10,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion last year, the United Nations says, with about half of the deaths in the past three months taking place far behind the front lines. The actual toll is expected to be “significantly higher” than the official tally since corroboration work is ongoing, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said on Tuesday. More than 560 children have been killed, and more than 18,500 people have been injured since the start of the conflict on February 24, 2022, said the mission, which has monitors across the country. The UN attributed the recent deaths far beyond the front lines to Russian forces’ use of long-range missiles and the explosion of abandoned ordinance. “As a result, no place in Ukraine is completely safe,” warned Danielle Bell, who heads the monitoring mission. At least 10,000 civilians, incl over 560 children, have been killed since the start of Russia's full-scale armed attack on Ukraine in February last year. Read the latest 👇 — UN Human Rights (@UNHumanRights) November 21, 2023  The death toll includes events in the first months after the invasion, such as the battle for control of the port of Mariupol, where residents reported high civilian casualties. Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians. “Ten thousand civilian deaths is a grim milestone for Ukraine,” Bell said. Russia’s war against Ukraine “now entering into its 21st month, risks evolving into a protracted conflict with the severe human cost being painful to fathom”, she said. The vast majority of the deaths have been caused by explosive weapons with a wide-area impact, such as shells, missiles and cluster munitions, the UN said. Representatives from several of Ukraine’s allies were in the capital, Kyiv, on Tuesday in a show of solidarity as the country marked 10 years since the beginning of mass protests that toppled a Russia-backed president and set the country on a pro-Western course.

       "  'Text': 'President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the protests marked Ukraine’s ‘first victory’ in its war with Russia. Ukraine’s pro-democracy, pro-Europe demonstrations in Maidan square a decade ago marked the “first victory” in its war with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared on the anniversary of the popular protest movement. Nearly 100 civilians died in violent clashes with security forces when Ukrainians took to the streets of the capital in 2013, demanding to move Ukraine out of the orbit of Vladimir Putin’s Russia and “join” the family of European democracies to which it “historically belongs”. The “Revolution of Dignity” protests ultimately led to the ouster of Kremlin-backed President Victor Yanukovych and gave space to the rise of a new generation of anticorruption, pro-democracy movement leaders. “The first victory in today’s war took place. A victory against indifference. A victory of courage. The victory of the Revolution of Dignity,” Zelenskyy said in a statement on Tuesday. He praised his country’s progress towards gaining membership in the European Union since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February of last year. “Year after year, step by step, we do our best to ensure that our star shines in the circle of stars on the EU flag, which symbolises the unity of the peoples of Europe. The star of Ukraine,” he said. His comments come as Russian forces chip away at\\xa0Ukraine’s\\xa0sovereignty and continue their full-on invasion of their smaller neighbour. A number of foreign leaders made trips to Kyiv in a show of solidarity. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius arrived by train for an unannounced visit to reaffirm Berlin’s backing for Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s troops. “I am here again, firstly to pledge further support, but also to express our solidarity and deep bond and also our admiration for the courageous, brave and costly fight that is being waged here,” he said laying flowers at Maidan square in central Kyiv. Also in Kyiv on Tuesday, European Council President Charles Michel, shared a post on the social media platform X, saying it was “Good to be back in Kyiv – among friends”. He posted a picture of himself shaking hands with the EU ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Mathernova. Moldova’s President Maia Sandu arrived in Kyiv early on Tuesday to join Zelenskyy in honouring the memory of those who died during the Revolution of Dignity, her office said on X. United States Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit to Kyiv on Monday “to meet with Ukrainian leaders and reinforce the staunch support of the United States for Ukraine’s fight for freedom”, the Pentagon said in a statement. The United Kingdom’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, visited Ukraine last week to underline British support for Kyiv amid its ongoing war with Russia. He told Zelenskyy the UK would support Ukraine for “however long it takes”. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on the anniversary of Maidan protests by blaming Ukraine and the West for the current war in which nearly 10,000 people have lost their lives. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova questioned what the dream of Europe had brought Ukraine. “From a prosperous, industrially developed, densely populated ex-Soviet republic, Ukraine has turned into an impoverished, dying territory,” she said, according to comments published on the Foreign Ministry website. Ukraine had lost its independence as a result of the Maidan events, she said. “Western colonisers determine its domestic and foreign policy.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry also made statements saying Russia cannot coexist with the “regime” in Ukraine. “The current regime is absolutely toxic, we do not see any options for co-existence with it at the moment,” Russian ambassador-at-large Rodion Miroshnik said on Tuesday. He further stated that in order for the war to end, Ukraine must be “de-militarised and de-nazified” so as not to be deemed a threat to Russia.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'US will send Ukraine anti-tank weapons, air-defence equipment and an additional HIMARS system. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has made a surprise visit to Kyiv where he unveiled a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $100m. Austin, on his first trip to Kyiv since April 2022, met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well as Defence Minister Rustem Umerov and Commander-in-Chief General Valerii Zaluzhnyi on Monday and promised the long-term support of the United States. “The message that I bring you today, Mr President, is that the United States of America is with you. We will remain with you for the long haul,” Austin told Zelenskyy. Austin said Ukraine’s effort to defeat Russian forces “matters to the rest of the world” and that US support would continue “for the long haul”. The new aid package includes anti-tank weapons, air-defence interceptors and an additional High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). Zelenskyy told Austin that his visit was “a very important signal” for Ukraine. “We count on your support,” the Ukrainian president said. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US has provided more than $44bn – and allies an additional $35bn – in security support that ranges from millions of bullets to air defence systems, advanced European and US battle tanks and, finally, pledges for F-16 fighter jets. But there are concerns that allied support is flagging amid the devastating Israel-Gaza war\\xa0and a perceived lack of progress in a Ukrainian counteroffensive that began in June. Fighting has been bogged down in the east of the country around ruined towns such as Bakhmut and Adviidka, although Ukraine has recently reported some success in the southern Kherson region, where it has established a foothold on the east bank of the Dnipro River, and in the Black Sea. However, as the cold weather sets in, it will become more difficult for either side to make large gains due to ground conditions. “I think they are prepared for combat in the winter,” Austin told reporters after his meetings, adding that the expectation was that Russia would be “even more aggressive”. Last year, Moscow relentlessly attacked Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and the power grid leaving millions of Ukrainians in the cold and dark at a time when temperatures are often below zero. Fred Kagan, a senior resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said it would be a mistake to think there is time to wait. “If we stop providing aid to Ukraine, it’s not that the stalemate continues. The aid is actually essential to preventing the Russians from beginning to manoeuvre again in ways that can allow them to defeat Ukraine,” Kagan told the Associated Press news agency. “So the cost of cutting off aid is that Russia wins and Ukraine loses and NATO loses.” Austin’s visit comes amid increasing division over aid for Ukraine in the US Congress. Some lawmakers want to make support for Israel a priority even though US defence officials stress that Washington can support both allies simultaneously, while a small, but vocal, group of Republicans oppose sending more aid to Ukraine, saying that taxpayers’ money should be spent at home.

       "  'Text': 'Ukraine’s president demands rapid changes in the operations of the war-torn country’s military medical system. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has demanded rapid changes in the operations of Ukraine’s military medical system, announcing the dismissal of the commander of the medical forces. Zelenskyy’s move was announced on Sunday as he met Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, and coincided with a debate over the conduct of the 20-month-old war against Russia, with questions over how quickly a counteroffensive in the east and south is proceeding. “In today’s meeting with Defence Minister Umerov, priorities were set,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. “There is little time left to wait for results. Quick action is needed for forthcoming changes.” Zelenskyy said he had replaced Major-General Tetiana Ostashchenko as commander of the Medical Forces of the Armed Forces. “The task is clear, as has been repeatedly stressed in society, particularly among combat medics, we need a fundamentally new level of medical support for our soldiers,” he said. This, he said, included a range of issues – better tourniquets, digitalisation and better communication. Umerov acknowledged the change in a post on the Telegram messaging app and laid out digitalisation, tactical medicine and rotation of servicepeople as his top priorities. “The experience of the effectiveness of specific units should be extended to the entire defence forces,” he said. Ukraine’s military reports on what it describes as advances in recapturing occupied areas in the east and south and last week acknowledged that troops had taken control of areas on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River in the southern Kherson region. Ukrainian commander-in-chief General Valery Zaluzhniy, in an essay published this month, said the war was entering a new stage of attrition, and Ukraine needed more sophisticated technology to counter the Russian military. While repeatedly saying advances will take time, Zelenskyy has denied the war is headed into a stalemate and has called on Kyiv’s Western partners, mainly the United States, to maintain levels of military support. Ostashchenko was replaced by Major-General Anatoliy Kazmirchuk, head of a military clinic in Kyiv. Her dismissal came a week after a Ukrainian news outlet suggested her removal, as well as that of others, was imminent following consultations with paramedics and other officials responsible for providing support to the military.

       "  'Text': 'Bohdan Yermokhin is one of 20,000 Ukrainian children who were illegally taken to Russia from Ukraine’s occupied regions. An orphaned Ukrainian teenager, who was taken to Russia from occupied regions of the war-torn country, has returned home ahead of his 18th birthday after mediation from the UN and Qatar, avoiding potential conscription in the Russian army. Bohdan Yermokhin was one of 20,000 Ukrainian children illegally taken to Russia since Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February last year, according to Ukraine. The practice is deemed a war crime by the International Criminal Court (ICC). The teenager, who had been living in the port city of Mariupol with his cousin after both his parents died, was captured by Russian troops in the first weeks of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and put into a foster home in Russia. Yemokhin tried to return home on his own through Belarus earlier this year but was stopped at the border and sent back. He appealed to Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy for help getting back ahead of his 18th birthday when he risked being drafted into the Russian army. On Sunday, Yomokhin arrived in Ukraine via Belarus, the Reuters news agency reported. “I believed I would be in Ukraine, but not on this day”, Yermokhin told reporters after crossing into Ukraine. “This is a very pleasant gift, to put it in the right way. The emotions are overwhelming, all good, with the notion that Ukraine needs me.” Zelenskyy welcomed Yermokhin’s return in his nightly video address. “Many attempts were made to help him. I am happy everything worked out,” he said, expressing thanks to Ukrainian officials, international organisations, and particularly the UN children’s fund, UNICEF, and authorities in Qatar for their mediation. The ICC claims Russia intends to “permanently [remove] these children from their own country”. It has issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Children’s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, saying there are “reasonable grounds to believe” they are responsible for the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. Russia denies the allegations, saying it has only sought to protect children from the risk of violence in war zones. The Kremlin says Moscow does not recognise the jurisdiction of the ICC. About 400 Ukrainian children taken to Russia during the war have been returned home. Yermokhin’s lawyer, Kateryna Bobrovska, has said the teen risked being conscripted into the Russian army after he had been told to report to a draft office near Moscow next month. She called on Zelenskyy to help bring him home, bringing international attention to the case. Lvova-Belova, Russia’s children’s commissioner, said Yermokhin left Russia on Saturday on a plane to Minsk, where he met a cousin, before continuing to Ukraine. She acknowledged that Yermokhin had wanted to be reunited with his relative. Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said he was grateful Yermokhin was back home after his long ordeal. “It was a thorny path. Bogdan went through a lot while in Russia, but despite everything, he wanted to be home! Today his wish has come true,” Lubinets said.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Ukrainian military says its defences shot down 15 out of 20 Iranian-made Shahed drones overnight. Russia has launched several waves of drone attacks on the Kyiv, Poltava and Cherkasy regions of Ukraine, stepping up its assaults on the Ukrainian capital after several weeks of respite, according to Ukrainian officials. “The enemy’s UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] were launched in many groups and attacked Kyiv in waves, from different directions, at the same time constantly changing the vectors of movement along the route,” Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said in a message on Telegram messaging app early on Sunday. “That is why the air raid alerts were announced several times in the capital.” Popko said preliminary information indicated that Ukraine’s air defence systems downed 10 Iranian-made Shahed kamikaze drones in Kyiv and the city’s outskirts. There were no initial reports of “critical damage” or casualties, he said. The Ukrainian Air Force said on its official Facebook page on Sunday morning that Russia attacked the Ukrainian territories from its Kursk region. It said air defences shot down 15 out of 20 drones that conducted the strikes. The reports could not independently be verified and there was no immediate comment from Russia. Russia began carrying out strikes on Ukraine’s energy, military and transport infrastructure in October 2022, six months after Moscow’s troops failed to take over the capital and withdrew to Ukraine’s east and south. Last winter, Russia pounded Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones, leaving millions without electricity, heating and water during the coldest months of the year – before easing the assaults in the summer. After a pause of 52 days, Moscow resumed air strikes on Kyiv earlier this month. On Saturday, Ukrainian officials said all drones heading towards Kyiv were destroyed, but some hit infrastructure facilities elsewhere in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other officials have warned that Russia will resume its large-scale bombardment of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure during the winter months. In his daily video message on Saturday evening, Zelenskyy announced new steps to bolster Ukraine’s air defences in the coming weeks. “The closer we get to winter, the greater Russia’s efforts will be to step up its attacks,” Zelenskyy said.

       "  'Text': 'Moscow begins shipments of 200,000 tonnes of grain months after it withdrew from UN-brokered Black Sea grain deal. Russia’s agriculture minister says Moscow has begun free shipments of grain totalling up to 200,000 tonnes to six African countries, as promised by President Vladimir Putin. In a statement posted on Telegram on Friday, Dmitry Patrushev said that ships headed for Burkina Faso and Somalia had already left Russian ports, and that additional shipments to Eritrea, Zimbabwe, Mali and Central African Republic would soon follow. Putin had promised to deliver free grain to the six countries at a summit with African leaders in July, soon after Moscow withdrew from a deal that had allowed Ukraine to ship grain from its Black Sea ports despite the war with Russia. The agreement, brokered by the United Nations and known as the Black Sea grain initiative, aimed to help avert famine by injecting more wheat, sunflower oil, fertiliser and other products into world markets, including for humanitarian needs. After Russia announced its plan to send free shipments, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that a “handful of donations” would not correct the “dramatic impact” caused by the end of the Black Sea deal. Since quitting the arrangement, Russia has repeatedly bombed Ukrainian ports and grain storage facilities, and Kyiv says hundreds of thousands of tonnes of cereals have been destroyed. In response to the collapse of the deal, Ukraine announced a “humanitarian corridor” hugging the western Black Sea coast near Romania and Bulgaria. On Friday, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency quoted a senior Ukrainian government official as saying that about 151 ships have used the new Black Sea shipping corridor since it was set up in August. A total of 4.4 million metric tonnes of cargo, including 3.2 million tonnes of grain, has been shipped via the corridor, Yuriy Vaskov, deputy minister for renovation and infrastructure, was quoted as saying. Vaskov said that 30 ships were being loaded at Ukrainian ports. They included 22 ships that would carry 700,000 tonnes of grain and eight ships readying 500,000 tonnes of other cargo. Ukraine is one of the world’s leading grain producers and exporters. Keeping grain exports flowing is key for its economy, which shrank by about a third last year. It is expected to grow by about 5 percent this year.               Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'At midnight ‘devices to prevent entry’ will go up at four of the border crossings between the European neighbours. Finland will place barriers on four of the eight border crossings it shares with Russia, as it seeks to stem a flow of asylum seekers. The Finnish Border Guard said on Friday that the barriers will go up at midnight (22:00 GMT) at the Vaalimaa, Nuijamaa, Imatra and Niirala crossings in southeastern Finland. “Our aim is to use barrier devices to prevent entry,” the Border Guard’s head of international affairs Matti Pitkaniitty told reporters. The measures are a response to changes in Russia’s border policy, he said. Helsinki has accused Moscow of encouraging or turning a blind eye to undocumented migrants crossing over. Russia has denied the claim. Finland announced earlier this week that it would close the four border crossings, which are the busiest points of travel between the two countries, with about 3,000 people crossing per day. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said that amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moscow was seeking to destabilise his country in response to Helsinki’s decision to join NATO. Finland’s action was supported by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “Russia’s instrumentalisation of migrants is shameful. I fully support the measures taken by Finland,” von der Leyen said on X. I had a call with PM @PetteriOrpo who informed me about the situation at the border with Russia. Russia’s instrumentalisation of migrants is shameful. I fully support the measures taken by Finland. And I thank the Finnish Border Guards for protecting our European borders. — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) November 16, 2023  Finland’s neighbour Norway, which shares a border with Russia in the Arctic, has said it is also ready to close its border at short notice if necessary. From Saturday, asylum seekers arriving via Russia will only be allowed to hand in their applications at two northern border crossings, at Salla and Vartius, Pitkaniitty said. The border closures come amid growing tension between Russia and Finland over Helsinki’s military alliances since Russia’s war with Ukraine began. Finland shares a 1,340km (833-mile) frontier with Russia that also serves as the European Union’s external border. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, EU member Finland abandoned its decades-long policy of military non-alignment. The country joined NATO in April. Russia said at the time that it would take unspecified “countermeasures” in response. Finland’s Border Guard has since tracked an uptick in undocumented arrivals, mostly from Africa and the Middle East. Finland’s ombudsman for non-discrimination said on Thursday that Helsinki still had a duty under international treaties and EU law to allow asylum seekers to seek protection. Finland is constructing a 200km (124-mile) fence on a section of the border, due to be completed by 2026.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

Ukraine’s armed forces claim to have made significant headway via a series of attacks on the Russian-occupied east bank of the Dnipro river. The country’s Marine Corps said in a statement published on social media on Friday that it had gained “a foothold on several bridgeheads” of Dnipro, near the key southern city of Kherson. The waterway is the de facto front line in the south of Ukraine. However, Russia conceded for the first time this week that Ukrainian forces had claimed back some territory on the opposing bank. “The Defence Forces of Ukraine conducted a series of successful operations on the left bank of the Dnipro River, along the Kherson front,” the marines said, and “managed to gain a foothold on several bridgeheads.” Russian and Ukrainian forces have been entrenched on opposite sides of the Dnipro river since Moscow withdrew from the western part of the Kherson region last November. The Russian-installed official responsible for occupied Kherson this week conceded that some Ukrainian soldiers were “blocked” in Krynky, a small village on the Dnipro’s eastern bank, and were facing a “fiery hell” from Russian artillery, rockets and drones.      Also on Friday, the Ukrainian Air Force said it had repelled another night of attacks. It reported that it had shot down nine out of 10 Russian drones overnight over the southern Mykolaiv and Odesa regions, and also near Zhytomyr in the centre, and in the Khmelnytskyi region in the west of the country. Russia has intensified its strikes on Ukraine’s grain infrastructure, including the major port at Odesa, since July, when Moscow pulled out of the Black Sea Grain Initiative; a wartime deal that enabled Ukraine’s exports to reach African countries facing the threat of hunger.

       "  'Text': 'Yale researchers say more than 2,400 children have been deported from Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine. Belarus has been collaborating with Moscow in the forcible transfer of thousands of Ukrainian children from Russian-occupied Ukraine in a programme “directly overseen” by the country’s President Alexander Lukashenko, according to research from Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL). The report (PDF), released on Thursday, said at least 2,442 children aged between six and 17 years old had been taken to 13 facilities across Belarus since Russia began its full-scale invasion in February 2022 until the end of October this year. “Russia and Belarus are targeting children for removal from Ukraine, coordinating their transport from occupied Ukraine through Russia to Belarus, and subjecting children to re-education, sometimes including military training, sometimes including military training,” the Yale HRL researchers said. They said Belarus’s authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, had “jointly directed and co-funded” the deportations with Putin under the Union State\\xa0initiative that was first agreed back in 1996. “Belarus’s direct involvement in Russia’s forced deportation of children represents a collaboration between Belarus’s authoritarian leader [Alexander] Lukashenka and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, with various pro-Russia and pro-regime organisations facilitating the deportation,” they said. Putin is already the subject of an International Criminal Court arrest warrant over Moscow’s alleged forcible transfer of Ukrainian children from occupied territories, along with the country’s Children’s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova. Taking children under the age of 18 across a border without the consent of a parent or guardian is illegal under international humanitarian law. Kyiv, which estimates some 19,000 children have been abducted, has already said it is investigating Belarus’s alleged involvement in the policy. In September, Belarus’s state media published photos of dozens of Ukrainian children arriving in the country from the Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhia regions for a “three-week holiday”. The children were shown getting off a train carrying backpacks and suitcases, mostly looking solemn. Alexei Talai, the head of the charity leading the programme, said Lukashenko had described it as an “important humanitarian project” that needed to continue. Talai was also mentioned as a facilitator in Thursday’s report. The Yale HRL is part of The Conflict Observatory, which receives funding from the United States. “These revelations of Belarusian involvement are part of a broader campaign directed by Russia,” the US State Department said in a statement. “Members of Russia’s military and government have deported hundreds of thousands of Ukraine’s civilians to Russia, including children who have been forcibly separated from their families. The United States will continue to pursue accountability for actors involved in abuses connected with Russia’s war against Ukraine.” Moscow has denied allegations that it is involved in forcible transfers or separating children from their families. The Yale HRL report said the children had been taken from at least 17 cities in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia regions, parts of which are occupied by Russia. They were put on trains to Rostov-on-Don in Russia before being transported to Belarus. It said more than 2,050 of the children had been taken to the “Dubrava children’s camp” in Minsk, the Belarusian capital. The researchers said it was not clear how many of the children it had documented remained in Belarus.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Alexandra Skochilenko was convicted of spreading ‘false information’ after she replaced five supermarket price tags with criticism of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Russian artist Alexandra Skochilenko has been sentenced to jail for seven years after being found guilty of spreading “false information” about the Russian military by replacing a handful of supermarket price tags with messages criticising the war in Ukraine. The 33-year-old, known as Sasha, is one of thousands of Russians to be detained, fined or jailed for speaking out against Moscow’s invasion of its neighbour amid an escalating crackdown on free speech and opposition to President Vladimir Putin. Skochilenko was arrested in her native St Petersburg in April 2022, after an elderly customer at the supermarket found the slogans on the price tags and notified the police. “The Russian army bombed an arts school in Mariupol. Some 400 people were hiding in it from the shelling,” one read, in reference to Russia’s brutal siege of the southern Ukrainian city. Another said, “Russian conscripts are being sent to Ukraine. Lives of our children are the price of this war.” Judge Oksana Demiasheva delivered the verdict on Thursday hours after Skochilenko, who has a congenital heart defect and coeliac disease, had made a final statement to the court, asking for compassion and to be set free. As well as the prison term, the artist was banned from using the internet for three years. Skochilenko, wearing a colourful T-shirt decorated with a large red heart, reacted with shock to the sentence, covering her face and wiping away tears. Supporters shouted “shame” and “we’re with you Sasha”, the AFP news agency reported. Skochilenko’s lawyers left without giving any comment. Skochilenko’s arrest came about a month after authorities adopted a law effectively\\xa0criminalising any public expression about the war that deviated from the Kremlin’s official line. Human rights group Memorial – now banned in Russia – said police spent 10 days interrogating supermarket staff and inspecting security camera footage before arresting the artist. “They sometimes give less for murder than for five price tags in a supermarket,” Boris Vishnevsky, a politician linked to the opposition Yabloko party, told AFP. “Hopefully, someday, the pendulum will turn the other way.” Skochilenko was accused of committing what the state prosecutor described as a serious crime out of “political hatred” towards Russia. He had asked\\xa0for her to be jailed for eight years. Skochilenko admitted to swapping the tags but denied that the text written on them was false. She said she was a pacifist who valued human life above all else. “How weak is our prosecutor’s faith in our state and society if he thinks our statehood and public safety can be ruined by five little pieces of paper?” she said in court. “Everyone sees and knows that you are not judging a terrorist. You’re not trying an extremist. You’re not even trying a political activist. You’re judging a pacifist,” she said. Amnesty International condemned the verdict. “Her persecution has become synonymous with the absurdly cruel oppression faced by Russians openly opposing their country’s criminal war,” it said in a statement. Memorial has designated Skochilenko a political prisoner and has launched a\\xa0campaign calling for her release. She has already been in detention for nearly 19 months, meaning that her overall term will be reduced by more than two years, since every day served in a pre-trial detention centre counts as 1.5 days of time served in a regular penal colony. But she has struggled in custody due to pre-existing health conditions, and her need for a gluten-free diet, according to her lawyers and her partner. According to OVD-Info, a prominent rights group that monitors political arrests and provides legal aid, a total of 19,834 Russians have been arrested between February 24 2022, when Russia began its invasion, and late October 2023 for speaking out or demonstrating against the war. Also on Thursday, opposition politician Vladimir Milov was convicted in absentia of spreading false information about the army and sentenced to eight years. Milov, who was once Russia’s deputy energy minister and is now an ally of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny, has left the country.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Finland accuses Russia of trying to destabilise the country by encouraging undocumented migration. Finland says it will close four of its eight border crossings with Russia where it has seen a surge in asylum seekers, accusing Moscow of turning a blind eye to undocumented people from mainly Africa and the Middle East to destabilise the country. Interior Minister Mari Rantanen said on Thursday that the border crossings in the southeastern regions of Vaalimaa, Nuijamaa, Imatra and Niirala would close on Saturday morning. The crossings are normally the busiest points of travel between Russia and Finland with about 3,000 people using them per day. Asylum seekers arriving via Russia will from Saturday have to turn in their applications at two northern border crossings, the government said. The border closures come amid growing tension between Russia and Finland, which share more than 1,300km (830 miles) of border, over Helsinki’s defence cooperation with the United States. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, Finland abandoned its decades-long policy of military non-alignment and joined NATO in April. Russia said it would take unspecified “countermeasures” in response.      Finland’s Border Guard has since tracked an uptick in undocumented arrivals, mostly from Africa and the Middle East. Finnish officials believe Moscow is encouraging people to go to the Finnish border, where they can apply for asylum. “It is clear that these people get help to get to the border. This seems like a very conscious decision”, Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said on Tuesday. Rantanen surmised: “Maybe [Russian officials] are annoyed by something in Finland’s activities.” The Kremlin, reacting to earlier reports that Finland was mulling a closure, put the blame on Helsinki for deteriorating ties. “We deeply regret that the Finnish leadership has chosen to deliberately move away from what used to be good relations,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday. Finland is constructing a 200km (124-mile) fence on a section of the border, due to be completed by 2026. At present, Finland’s borders are secured primarily by light wooden fences, mainly designed to stop livestock from wandering into the neighbouring country.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'David Cameron tells Ukraine’s president that London would support Kyiv for ‘however long it takes’. The United Kingdom’s newly appointed foreign secretary, David Cameron, has made a visit to Ukraine to underline British support for Kyiv amid its ongoing war with Russia, according to his office. The former prime minister, making his first working trip abroad as Britain’s top diplomat, told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that his country would support Ukraine for “however long it takes”. “I wanted this to be my first visit,” Cameron said. “I admire the strength and determination of the Ukrainian people.” He was named foreign secretary on Monday in a surprise cabinet reshuffle. Zelenskyy said he was grateful for Cameron’s gesture, which comes amid Israel’s war in Gaza that he worries has diverted attention from Ukraine’s drawn-out battle with Russia, in its 21st month. “The world is not so focused on the battlefield situation in Ukraine, and this dividing of the focus really does not help,” Zelenskyy said.      The UK has been a close ally of Ukraine throughout the war, and Cameron told Zelenskyy Britain would continue to be there for moral, diplomatic and military support. “What I want to say by being here is that we will continue to give you the moral support, the diplomatic support … but above all the military support that you need not just this year and next year, but however long it takes,” Cameron said. He added that the UK would work with its allies “to make sure the attention is here in Ukraine”. Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Cameron had also engaged in talks on issues related to armaments, arms production, and security in the Black Sea while in Kyiv. Ukraine did not say when the talks took place. Due to stringent wartime security regulations, the details of foreign dignitaries’ trips are sometimes released late. As of last month, the UK said it was second to the United States in providing military funds to Ukraine, giving 4.6 billion pounds ($5.7bn) worth of assistance and training 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers on British soil.

       "  'Text': 'The European Union considers massive military and state aid packages as Ukraine claims 10,000 Russian troops killed in Avdiivka assault. Ukraine and Russia both scored some territorial successes and flung missiles and drones at each other during the 90th week of the war, each showing little sign of abatement. But much of the main action was in Europe’s capitals. European Union members debated whether to grant Ukraine 20 billion euros ($22bn) in military aid and 50 billion euros ($54bn) in state and reconstruction aid over four years, and whether to invite Ukraine to start membership talks at the European summit in December. Both actions would send a powerful message to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin that Europe’s resolve to help Ukraine has not weakened. Europe also prepared a 12th package of sanctions, making it harder for Russia to sell its oil around the world. The United Kingdom, meanwhile, ensured that Ukrainian grain would continue to be exported through the Black Sea, by brokering an insurance agreement that lowered the cost of war risk to freighters. That cost briefly rose after Russia struck a sixth civilian cargo vessel on November 8. Ukraine built up its bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnipro river during the week, threatening Russian forces at the western extremity of the front. Russian reporters said Ukraine advanced to new positions around Krynky, a town 20km (12 miles) east of Kherson City, on November 9. Geolocated footage confirmed the advance on November 13. The reports also said continuous Ukrainian artillery was pinning down Russian troops in towns between Krynky and Kherson City. Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said the armed forces were doing “everything possible to knock out the Russians from the left bank” in a statement on November 11, the first anniversary of a tactical Russian withdrawal from the territory it held in Kherson west of the river. Two days later, Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office, said, “Against all odds, Ukraine’s Defence Forces have gained a foothold on the left bank of the Dnieper [Dnipro river].” Ukrainian headway seemed to have caught Russia unprepared to communicate. On November 9, the day of the Ukrainian advance, Russia’s military said it had thwarted Ukraine’s attempt to gain a bridgehead on the left bank, killing 500 Ukrainian servicemen in a week. On November 13, Russia’s state TASS news agency and RIA Novosti newspaper published reports that Russia was ordering the redeployment of elements of the “Dnipro” group of forces in Kherson to “more advantageous positions”. Both withdrew the reports within minutes, issuing an apology. Russia, too, made advances. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said Russian forces launched 30 attacks north and south of Bakhmut, an unusually high number, on November 8 and 9. Geolocated footage showed they had regained control of a railway line running south of Bakhmut and advanced north of the city. “The Russians have stepped up and are trying to recover previously lost positions” in Bakhmut, wrote Ukrainian ground forces commander Oleksandr Syrsky on Telegram. Russia also kept up pressure on Avdiivka, the eastern city south of Bakhmut it is trying to encircle. Ukraine’s military chief of staff, Valery Zaluzhny, said on November 10 that Russia had lost 10,000 men in the first month of its assault on Avdiivka. “During this time, our soldiers destroyed more than 100 enemy tanks, 250 other armoured vehicles, about fifty artillery systems and 7 Su-25 aircraft. The enemy’s total losses in manpower amount to about 10,000 people,” he wrote on social media. Neither Ukraine’s nor Russia’s claims of the other’s losses could be independently verified. Ukraine and Russia also sparred from a distance. Ukraine’s air force said it downed 19 out of 31 Shahed drones Russia fired off on November 10. Russia also fired a Kh-31 missile, an Onyx anti-ship missile and an S-300 air defence missile into Ukrainian territory, adopting a Ukrainian technique of using drones and missiles together to help overwhelm air defences. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said it downed two Ukrainian drones on the same day, one near Moscow and the other near the Russian border with Belarus. Baza, a Russian Telegram channel with links to security services, suggested one was targeting a machine plant in Kolomna, 100km (62 miles) southeast of Moscow. Ukraine has consistently asked allies for more air defence systems. On November 9, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister asked France for additional ammunition for air defence systems, and to participate in pilot training for F-16s. That pilot training took a major step forward on November 9, when five Dutch F-16s arrived at the Fetesti Air Base in Romania for pilot training. Four days later, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said F-16 pilot training had begun in a video address. The European F-16 Training Centre (EFTC) in Fetesti is to train non-Ukrainian pilots as well. The Netherlands is lending the EFTC 12-18 of its F-16s for training purposes, and helping coordinate the effort to provide Ukraine with its own F-16s. Ukrainian Deputy Energy Minister Farid Safarov recently told a NATO meeting that F-16s were the best way for Ukraine to defend its energy infrastructure from Russian attacks during the winter, but it was not certain how soon Ukraine would have operational F-16s. The EU was finalising a 12th package of sanctions on Russia that could be approved on Wednesday, the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday, November 13. “This 12th package will include … new export bans, among them … diamonds,” Borrell told reporters, indicating there would also be “actions to tighten the oil price cap, in order to decrease the revenue that Russia is getting from selling its oil – not to us but to others – [and] fighting against circumvention”. Days earlier, the European Parliament had called for tougher enforcement of European sanctions against Russian oil – and for an extension of those sanctions. The resolution said refined oil products from Russian oil were finding their way into the EU from India, and gas was continuing to enter the EU directly. But the most important European contributions to Ukraine’s security could come in December. Ukraine has been lobbying for an invitation to open membership talks, and the European Commission supports that demand.      “We are working to get an unconditional decision to start negotiations,” said Zelenskyy in a November 13 video address. “It is fundamental for Ukraine to implement all the recommendations of the European Commission that were given, all seven recommendations, and to do what is necessary at this stage of our journey to the European Union.” The EU last year said it would grant Ukraine candidate status if it passed legislation to fight corruption and money laundering, limit the influence of oligarchs, secure the integrity of the judiciary and guarantee the rights of ethnic minorities. At the same summit, the EU is to decide on whether to approve a 50 billion-euro ($54.2bn) financial aid package for Ukraine for the period 2024-27. The European Parliament has already given a green light to the so-called “Ukraine Facility”, designed to help finance the state as it transitions to EU membership and to rebuild the country. Separately, EU diplomats were considering a 20-billion euro ($22bn) military aid package that would commit members to spending 5 billion euros ($5.4bn) a year over four years. EU diplomats said on November 14 that there was resistance to the package. The EU’s foreign policy chief proposed the military budget in July. Among the sceptics was reportedly Germany, a stalwart provider of military aid to Ukraine so far, and this despite the fact that it proposed doubling its military aid to Ukraine to 8 billion euros ($8.7bn) next year. The governing coalition had reportedly agreed to the increase and would submit it for committee discussion on November 16. “It is a strong signal to Ukraine that we will not leave them in the lurch,” German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius is quoted as having said. Germany’s 8 billion-euro ($8.7bn) pledge came as Chancellor Olaf Scholz sought to ensure that Germany would meet a NATO defence spending minimum of 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) over the medium term. Germany is on track to spend 1.57 percent of GDP this year, and the 8 billion-euro ($8.7bn) pledge puts it over 2 percent for next year.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'President Zelenskyy’s chief of staff says Ukrainian forces have secured their position on the east bank of the Dnipro. Ukrainian forces have secured a pivotal position on the eastern shore of the Dnipro River, a senior official said. The claim of momentum in the Ukrainian military’s counteroffensive, made by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff in the United States on Tuesday, came as Kyiv presses the West to raise the supply of arms. “Against all odds, Ukraine’s Defense Forces have gained a foothold on the left (east) bank of the Dnipro,” Andriy Yermak told the Hudson Institute think tank in the US, as posted on Zelenskyy’s website. The statement was the first official confirmation of Ukraine’s establishment of a foothold on the Dnipro’s east bank in the Kherson region. This opens up a potential route towards Crimea. The peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, has been the focus of Ukrainian attacks in recent weeks. “Step by step, they are demilitarising Crimea. We have covered 70% of the distance. And our counteroffensive is developing,” Yermak told Hudson Institute. Russian forces seized Ukraine’s southern Kherson region in the early days of the February 2022 invasion. However, late last year, they pulled out of the regional capital, also called Kherson, and left the Dnipro’s west bank. Attacks have since been launched on Kherson and other towns from the east bank, soliciting a response from Ukraine. A Ukrainian military spokesperson this month said Ukraine had achieved “not bad results” in pushing Russian troops to relocate. Unofficial accounts have noted Ukrainian advances. In a highly unusual incident on Monday, two Russian state news agencies published alerts saying Moscow was moving troops to “more favourable positions” east of the Dnipro in Ukraine, only to withdraw the information minutes later. In the past, Russia has sometimes used similar phrasing about moving troops to more advantageous positions to describe retreats. The announcement of Ukraine’s southern foothold came as Zelenskyy also pointed to heavy Russian losses in the shattered eastern city of Avdiivka, which he said was undermining Moscow’s broader war goals. Moscow’s forces have focused on eastern Ukraine since failing to advance on Kyiv in the first days of the February 2022 invasion. They have taken aim at Avdiivka since mid-October and officials from the town, which had a pre-war population of 32,000, say not a single building remains intact. Zelenskyy, in an address on Tuesday night, said Russian assaults in the eastern Donetsk region, including Avdiivka, had been “very intense” but that Russia was rapidly losing manpower and equipment. Yermak, in his address to the Hudson Institute, said Russia’s strategy against Ukraine was “to outlast and out-endure the unity of democracies” and called on allies to provide more military aid to bolster Ukraine’s defence. “We need weapons right now. Russia still has air superiority,” he told the gathering. “It still is capable of producing missiles due to circumvention of sanctions. Not to mention the Iranian drones and North Korean artillery rounds.” The US has sent more than $46bn in military aid to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion. However, since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7, conservative US lawmakers have expressed scepticism about further aiding Ukraine and advocated for redirecting funds to Israel. Germany, another key Ukraine ally, recently announced plans to double its military aid to Ukraine to $8.6bn next year.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Former police officer had been serving a 20-year sentence over his role in the killing of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya. A man convicted for his role in the killing of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya has been pardoned after fighting in Ukraine, according to his lawyer and local media reports. Politkovskaya, who was well known for reporting on abuses in Russia’s war in Chechnya early in Vladimir Putin’s presidency, was shot dead outside her flat in Moscow in 2006. The killing triggered an outcry in the West and underlined the growing dangers of reporting in Russia as Putin gradually clamped down on independent media. Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, a former police officer, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2014 for organising the killing. “As a special forces fighter, [Khadzhikurbanov] was invited to sign a contract to participate in the special military operation… When the contract expired, he was pardoned by presidential decree,” Khadzhikurbanov’s lawyer Alexei Mikhalchik told the AFP news agency.      Khadzhikurbanov was convicted along with four other men from Chechnya, a mostly Muslim region in the northern Caucasus where Russia and its local allies crushed two rebellions, in 1994-96 and, under Putin, in 1999-2009. In 2018, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg found that, while the authorities had found and convicted a group of men who had directly carried out the contract killing, they had “failed to take adequate investigatory steps to find the person or persons who had commissioned the murder”. Politkovskaya, who did much of her work for the independent investigative magazine Novaya Gazeta, now banned in Russia, won more than a dozen international prizes for reporting on abuses committed in Chechnya by Russian and allied forces as well as by rebels, despite repeated detentions and death threats. Many Russian prisoners have been sent to fight in Ukraine since Moscow launched its offensive last February, with critics warning some have committed new crimes after returning from the front. The Kremlin last week acknowledged the use of prisoner recruits to fight in Ukraine and said convicts who “atone for their crime on the battlefield with blood” could be pardoned. “They are atoning with blood in storm brigades, under bullets and under shells,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday.      Russia has probably recruited 100,000 people from prisons to fight in Ukraine, Olga Romanova, the head of an independent prisoners’ rights group has estimated. Local Russian media outlets have reported several instances of released prisoners going on to commit serious offences, including murders, after having left the army.

       "  'Text': 'Media barred from reporting on election body’s actions at military bases or areas under martial law without clearance. Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved changes to a law that will curtail media coverage of next year’s presidential election, according to local news agencies. The elections are due to be held in March. The 71-year-old president, who has led the country for 24 years, is expected to stand for another six-year term. Putin has not officially declared he will run, saying he will announce that only after parliament formally sets the election date. The changes Putin greenlighted limit coverage of Central Election Commission sessions to registered media outlets, which could exclude freelancers or independent journalists, according to the reports on Tuesday. The amendments prohibit media from reporting on the commission’s actions at military bases or in areas under martial law without advance clearance from regional and military authorities. They also bar the publication of any campaign content on “blocked sources”, referring to restricted websites and social media services. Under an intensifying crackdown on the opposition and the flow of information, Russia has banned an array of websites and services, including Facebook and Instagram. To enforce this ban, the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media also reportedly plans to block certain virtual private networks (VPNs) that Russians widely use to bypass internet restrictions. The state-owned news agency RIA quoted the ministry on Sunday as saying that it could block certain “VPN services and VPN protocols” that an expert commission identifies as a “threat.” Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, it has clamped down on independent and dissenting media voices, watchdogs have said. Hundreds of journalists have gone into exile as state censors have closed many respected independent media outlets and launched criminal cases against prominent journalists and regional bloggers. “After Russian tanks entered Ukraine, the authorities switched to a scorched-earth strategy that has turned Russia’s media landscape into a wasteland,” Amnesty International’s director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Marie Struthers,\\xa0said in March 2022. Russian polling agencies have found that Putin’s approval rating remains high – even as much as 82 percent in October. He appears easily poised to win if he runs for re-election.

The ministry said that the reports by two state news agencies on Monday, discussing Russian troop movements in Ukraine,\\xa0were “false”. The reports were quickly withdrawn after publication. “The transmission of a false report about the “regrouping” of troops in the Dnipro area, allegedly on behalf of the Russian Defence Ministry’s press centre, is a provocation,” the ministry said, according to the RBC news outlet. The reports, by the RIA Novosti and TASS agencies, had said that Russian troops were being moved to “more favourable positions” east of the Dnipro River in Ukraine. The Kremlin’s spokesperson declined to comment on the incident, which has been flagged as illustrating disarray among the military establishment regarding media work, saying it was a matter for the military. On Friday, Russia’s military said that its forces had thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to forge a bridgehead on the eastern bank of the Dnipro and on nearby islands. Last week, The US-based Institute for the Study of War said that Ukraine appeared to have conducted assaults across the Dnipro in Kherson region in mid-October, and noted that Russian military bloggers were reporting continued Ukrainian ground operations on the east bank. According to ISW’s assessment as of November 12, while Russian forces conducted a limited series of missile strikes targeting southern Ukraine, “the Russian government is attempting to downplay the extent of its efforts to strengthen control over the Russian information space”. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials say that Russian forces have ramped up attacks in eastern Ukraine in an attempt to gain ground near two key front line cities. “Toward Bakhmut, the Russians have become more active and are trying to recapture previously lost positions,” General Oleksandr Syrskyi wrote in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. “Enemy attacks are being repelled,” he added.

       "  'Text': 'President Zelenskyy has denied Ukraine was behind blasts that cut off a major route for Russian gas exports to Europe. A Ukrainian special forces commander played a key role in sabotaging the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September last year, according to an investigation by two international newspapers. Mystery has surrounded who was behind the blasts that damaged the pipelines – which run from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea – cutting off a major route for Russian gas exports to Europe and heightening already high tensions over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Different theories have emerged pointing the finger at Ukraine, Russia or the United States. All have denied involvement. A joint investigation by The Washington Post newspaper and German outlet Der Spiegel, published on Saturday, singled out Roman Chervinsky, a 48-year-old who served in Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces. The officer’s alleged role provides the most direct evidence to date tying Ukraine’s military and security leadership to the sabotage that spawned multiple criminal investigations. Chervinsky was the “coordinator”, the reports claimed, citing officials in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe, as well as other people with knowledge of the operation, who spoke anonymously.      He oversaw logistics and support for a six-person team, which rented a sailing boat using false identities and diving equipment to place explosive charges on the pipelines, according to the Post. The blasts ruptured three of the four pipelines that make up Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, spewing gas into the Baltic Sea, near Bornholm, Denmark. Russian energy giant Gazprom halted flows through Nord Stream 1, the main conduit for Russian natural gas to Germany, amid disputes over the war in Ukraine a month earlier. The newly completed Nord Stream 2 twin pipelines never opened as Berlin pulled the plug on the project days before Russian troops entered Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The Nord Stream attack hit civilian infrastructure built to provide energy to millions of people in Europe. Ukraine had long complained that Nord Stream would allow Russia to bypass Ukrainian pipes, depriving Kyiv of transit revenue. According to the report, Chervinsky did not act alone nor did he plan the operation. Instead, he took orders from more senior Ukrainian officials, who ultimately reported to General Valerii Zaluzhny, Ukraine’s highest-ranking military officer, it said. He denied any role in the sabotage through his lawyer. “All speculations about my involvement in the attack on Nord Stream are being spread by Russian propaganda without any basis,” he said in a statement to the Post and Der Spiegel. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly denied his country was behind the sabotage. “I would never do that,” he told Germany’s Bild newspaper in June, adding that he would “like to see proof”. But the Nord Stream operation was designed to keep Zelenskyy in the dark, the Post reported. The two media outlets said the Ukrainian government did not respond to requests for comment on their investigation. US and Western officials have called the act a dangerous attack on Europe’s energy infrastructure. Chervinsky is currently in jail in Kyiv on charges of allegedly abusing his power during an attempt to persuade a Russian pilot to defect in July 2022. He says his prosecution is political retribution for having criticised Zelenskyy, according to the reports. Russia alleged that Washington was behind the attack, with President Vladimir Putin dismissing the argument that Ukraine was behind the explosions.               Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

Russian forces have intensified their attacks on key points of the front line as they go on the offensive in Ukraine. Ukraine’s general staff reported late on Thursday that its military had repelled Russian assaults across the front earlier in the day, including around the strategic eastern towns of Avdiivka and Bakhmut as Moscow’s forces become more active following Kyiv’s counteroffensive over the summer. Ukrainian forces are reported to have repelled 11 attacks near Avdiivka, 15 in the Maryinka sector and 22 to the northeast in Bakhmut. Six attacks were repelled farther north near Kupiansk, the general staff said. As Moscow ramps up its offensive, President Vladimir Putin paid a surprise visit to Russia’s military headquarters for the campaign in Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia, the Kremlin said on Friday. The president surveyed plans and equipment on his second visit there in under a month. Russian troops have been bearing down on Avdiivka since mid-October. The industrial town’s position as a gateway to the provincial capital of Donetsk, 20km (12 miles) to the east makes it highly strategic. A press officer for Ukraine’s 3rd Separate Assault Brigade told the news outlet Espreso TV that Russian forces have been launching major infantry attacks. “It is not just infantry advancing but also parallel work of artillery, drones, aviation, the same air bombing and more,” he said. However, the officer said Russian forces have been unable to replenish supplies quickly and Ukrainian defensive positions were solid. The head of Avdiivka’s military administration told Espreso that Russian forces were shelling the town “round the clock” but wet ground from several days of rain was holding them back. “Once the ground dries, they will definitely advance,” he added. Russia’s Investigative Committee, in an account of the day’s fighting, said Ukrainian forces shelled the town of Skadovsk in a Russian-occupied area of the southern region of Kherson. The report said there were dead and wounded in the attack. Russia’s Ministry of Defence also reported strikes on Ukrainian troops and equipment near Bakhmut. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said on Friday that Ukrainian forces damaged two small Russian landing boats in Crimea during an overnight attack using sea drones. The statement said the vessels were crewed and loaded with armoured vehicles. The extent of the damage was not immediately clear. Meanwhile, the news agency RIA quoted Russia’s Defence Ministry as saying its air defences had brought down two Ukrainian drones over Crimea and one over the Tula region south of Moscow. Reports from both the Russian and Ukrainian sides could not be independently confirmed. As the fighting continues, Putin assessed the state of his country’s forces in Ukraine during his overnight visit to the Southern Military District headquarters in Rostov-on-Don. Video shared by a Russian state news agency showed him being greeted by Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff, late on Thursday. Putin was “introduced to new types of military equipment” and was informed about the progress of the war, his spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Russian state news agency Tass. The Russian president made the visit on the way back from a trip to Kazakhstan, where he aimed to cement ties with Russia’s former Soviet neighbour and major economic partner in the midst of tensions with the West over Ukraine.

       "  'Text': 'Air wars heat up over Ukraine as front-line battles hit a stalemate, while on the diplomatic front, the EU warms up to Kyiv. Russia and Ukraine traded missile strikes in the 89th week of the war, using air power to overcome the perception that their forces on the ground had reached a stalemate. “Russia controls the skies,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during a news conference on November 4. Moscow had provided a reminder of that air superiority the previous night, when it launched 40 Shahed drones against Ukraine, one of the largest salvoes in recent weeks. Ukraine said it shot down 24, but the remaining 16 struck critical infrastructure and civilian homes. Among the targets were a military facility in Ivano-Frankivsk and “infrastructure facilities” in Lviv and Odesa. Two nights later, Russia again showed its superior firepower with a combination of 22 Shahed drones and four missiles of various types. Ukraine said it shot down 15 drones and two of the missiles, but the general staff said the remainder destroyed port infrastructure in Odesa and civil infrastructure in Kherson city. That same night, Russia dropped 87 glide bombs into Kherson – the largest salvo of that munition so far in the war.  The worst strike came in broad daylight on November 3. More than 20 soldiers were reported killed by a Russian Iskander missile when it hit an award ceremony for the 128th Separate Assault Mountain Transcarpathian Brigade in Zaporizhia. “This is a tragedy that could have been avoided,” Zelenskyy said in a video address. Defence Minister Rustem Umerov ordered a full investigation. Ukraine, too, scored important successes in the air war. A Russian news outlet, Astra, said on November 1, four Ukrainian missiles hit a command post for the Dnipr group in the village of Strilkove, on the Arabat Spit off the east coast of Crimea, killing two soldiers and wounding three. Three days later, Ukraine severely damaged a Russian corvette while it lay in a shipyard in the port of Kerch. Later photographs showed it to be the Askold, a Karakurt-class Kalibr missile carrier. The Karakurt-class corvettes first went into construction in 2016 and are among Russia’s most modern, while the Zalyv shipyard, where the strike occurred, is one of three servicing the Black Sea Fleet. “The Zalyv shipyard is the largest shipyard in Eastern Europe and is likely the main repair facility for the [Black Sea Fleet] in Crimea following a successful Ukraine strike on the Russian state-owned ship repair facility Sevmorzavod in Sevastopol on September 13,” said the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. The strike on the Askold “will likely render it inoperable for the foreseeable future”, the ISW said.  The Russian Ministry of Defence said Ukraine fired 15 missiles at the port, 13 of which had been shot down. There were other incidents that showed the high priority Ukraine placed on air strikes. Russian military reporters said Ukraine attacked Skadovsk in Kherson with missiles on the night of November 4 and struck the port of Berdyansk with Storm Shadow missiles on November 5. Russian sources also claimed that a salvo of Ukrainian drones targeting a railway in Crimea had been downed. All this air activity appeared to be trying to make up for the lack of any great movement on the ground. Ukrainian forces reported small gains near the eastern city of Bakhmut, which they are slowly trying to encircle, and a successful defence against a Russian attempt to encircle Avdiivka, to the south of Bakhmut. There was only one report of note – Russian military reporters said Ukraine had landed more troops on the left bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson and was operating a battalion-sized force of about 300 soldiers including armoured vehicles near the village of Krynky. There was much talk of stalemate during the week. Ukraine’s chief of staff kicked off the theme. “Just like in the First World War we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate,” Valery Zaluzhny was quoted as saying in an interview published alongside an article he wrote in The Economist. Zaluzhny\\xa0said the Ukraine war was moving towards an attritional stage that benefited the side with deeper resources: “This will benefit Russia, allowing it to rebuild its military power, eventually threatening Ukraine’s armed forces and the state itself.” Both governments moved to erase the notion of stalemate. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied the war had reached a “dead end”, while Zelenskyy said, “Today time has passed and people are tired. But this is not a stalemate”, during a news conference with visiting European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.  Reports suggest Ukraine’s soldiery is indeed exhausted from almost two years of constant fighting. Zaluzhny said that to break the stalemate Ukraine needed to gain control of the air. “Basic weapons, such as missiles and shells, remain essential. But Ukraine’s armed forces need key military capabilities and technologies to break out of this kind of war. The most important one is air power,” he wrote. Igor Girkin, the Russian commander who formed and led the separatist Donetsk militia in 2014, feared this Western superiority in air technology in an analysis dated October 26. Russian troops, too, are exhausted, he said, and unable to conduct “even limited offensive operations”, as evidenced in the failure of the Avdiivka offensive. “Our troops will have to spend the rest of the autumn-winter campaign on the defensive, trying to the best of their ability to eliminate emerging operational crises,” he wrote. “Worse, by the spring of next year, our active army will probably be even less capable of offensive operations than it is now, and the enemy will be seriously strengthened in military-technical terms, which will allow him to continue to try to control the strategic initiative.” Zelenskyy told the Reuters NEXT conference that Ukraine had a battle plan for next year that included “concrete directions where we can go”. Both sides were busy resupplying themselves with ordnance, but Ukraine also hopes for a qualitative leap by spring, when it expects to receive F-16 fighter jets from Western arsenals converting to the fifth-generation F-35. These, it hopes, supplied with US air-to-air missiles, will finally give it mastery of its airspace and an edge in the Black Sea. But the Ukrainian leader dismissed calls for a March 2024 election, when Russia is to hold one. Reuters quoted unnamed Russian sources as saying Putin has decided to run for a fifth presidential term. On November 6, Reuters quoted unnamed sources in the European Commission saying Von der Leyen would support inviting Ukraine to start EU membership talks at the December summit of the European Council. Ukraine expected a positive report from the Commission towards Council members, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna said. “I would say that the assessment would definitely be positive because we have been in permanent contact with the European Commission, discussing the steps and negotiating the steps we managed to implement,” Stefanishyna told Reuters. She said Ukraine had carried out all seven steps deemed necessary for a positive invitation. Three days earlier, Von der Leyen had praised Ukraine for its progress towards EU-mandated reforms and said she was “confident” of Ukraine’s soon reaching the “next stage” of the process of accession. “I must say you have made excellent progress,” she told Zelenskyy during their joint news conference in Kyiv. There may also have been another convergence in the offing between Ukraine and Brussels. Ukraine’s deputy justice minister said European Union leaders were considering allowing the proceeds from frozen Russian assets to be used to assist Ukraine – a long-standing Ukrainian demand. Approximately $300bn in Russian assets were in European hands, and their proceeds amounted to $3.6bn since the war began, said Iryna Mudra.           Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'As the war in Ukraine drags on, the Kremlin is trying to win audiences over at the movies. Kyiv, Ukraine – A Belgian violinist arrives in Ukraine to play for an art-loving oligarch – and witnesses the first days of Russia’s full-scale invasion. He sees how Ukrainian servicemen “kill” civilians and “shell” a railway station to blame the deaths on the Russians whose purpose is Ukraine’s “liberation” from a Western-backed “neo-Nazi junta”. The servicemen sporting swastika tattoos electrocute the violinist, and “rape” and “murder” his female manager. He barely escapes only to see how Western politicians and media “plot” against Russia. Svidetel (Witness) was the first feature film about the ongoing war, directed by David Dadunashvili, and released in Russia in August in 1,131 movie theatres. But with a budget of about $2m, it was one of the biggest box office bombs, taking a mere $70,000 in the first four days. Aggressive advertising and the absence of competition – there are hardly any Hollywood films screened due to Western sanctions – did not help. The film’s producers did not release further box office information. On IMDB, a review-aggregator website, Svidetel stars one out of 10 and enjoys nothing but scathing reviews. “It’s a lie upon a lie upon a lie, and artists don’t even bother pretending they’re serious,” Konstantin, an English teacher from the western city of Tula, told Al Jazeera. “It should be shown in Ukraine as a comedy.” Since 2014, a dozen films on the annexation of Crimea and pro-Moscow separatists in Ukraine’s Donbas region have been shot in Russia. Each flopped at the box office – and were so insignificant and obscure, that even the most outspoken warmonger failed to notice them. “In the past nine years, the state [not individuals, but the state] didn’t manage to make films about the heroes of Donbas,” Zakhar Prilepin, a novelist who joined the separatists and confessed to committing war crimes, wrote last year on his blog. He also decried the exodus of actors and filmmakers from Russia – along with writers, rock and rap stars. Last November, the Culture Ministry allocated $395m for movies that would cover “the current confrontation with the ideologies of Nazism and fascism”, the war in Ukraine and Russia’s “spiritual leaders and volunteers”. One of them will be a television series based on Prilepin’s novel, The Volunteers’ Romance. Director Oleg Lukichev said the series would contemplate “the Russian identity”. In 2018, Prilepin starred in a rare critically acclaimed film about the war. Phone Duty, a short feature about the Donbas rebels, got the Best Narrative Short prize at the Tribeca Film Festival in the United States. Thousands of Ukrainians signed a petition demanding an apology from the festival’s organisers. Another commercial flop is Crimea, a 2017 melodrama commissioned by Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu that cost his ministry about $2.5m. But its creators were not after profits – they made it available on file exchange networks and YouTube. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova urged Ukrainians to watch it “for enlightenment and contemplation”. A review on Film.ru, Russia’s main cinephile portal, described it as “crippled and unsophisticated propaganda”. Meanwhile, Russia cancelled screenings and the distribution of Donbas, a 2018 drama by Ukrainian director Serhiy Loznitsa that was awarded at the Cannes Film Festival in France. Despite Crimea’s symbolic significance in today’s Russia, other movies about it have failed to win moviegoers over. The Crimean Bridge – Made with Love, a slapstick comedy written by outspoken propagandist Margarita Simonyan and shot by her husband Tigran Keosayan cost $1.4m but earned $250,000. It got a rating of 2.5 out of 10 on the Kinopoisk.ru review aggregator – something Keosayan blamed on “sick people” and “Ukrainian bots”. In stark contrast, some Soviet-era masterpieces that were funded and censored by Communist officials are still studied in film schools worldwide. Battleship Potemkin by Sergei Eisenstein was a 1925 breakthrough in film editing. Earth, a 1930 silent drama by Alexander Dovzhenko about collective farms, was screened in 2015 by UNESCO to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the United Nations’ culture branch. Andrey Tarkovsky’s and Sergey Paradzhanov’s arthouse meditations won strings of international awards – and still inspire filmmakers and even pop stars like Lady Gaga. “Unlike Eisenstein or Dovzhenko, these days, nobody truly believes in what they’re doing,” Askold Kurov, who filmed and co-produced Welcome to Chechnya, a 2020 award-winning documentary about the persecution of LGBTQ Chechens, told Al Jazeera. Soviet filmmakers believed in Communism’s messianic message, revolutionised cinematic expression, and developed a new artistic language. But their experiments were cut short by the Stalinist dogmas of “socialist realism”, he said. Russia’s current ideology is a hotchpotch of anti-Western nationalism and nostalgia for the Soviet and czarist past. “These days, everything the government commissions turns into boring crap. Because decent people don’t get involved,” Kurov said. “Because there is embezzlement of huge budgets, they need directors and producers who are easy and safe to deal with.” Another reason could be the very fabric of filmmaking. Out of roughly 200 Russian films released annually, only a handful turn a profit. Many filmmakers prefer to rely on state subsidies – and embezzle sizeable parts, an industry insider says. “They hope for freebies from the state. And the freebies roll in, but are stolen by those who get them,” an actor, who has played in dozens of Russian films and television series, told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity. “Far less than a half” of the budget reaches the production team, he said, but everyone in the production chain is involved in the corruption. “Corruption is not something that corrodes the system but something that holds it together,” he said. Russia’s film industry underwent a painful transformation in the 1990s, and only by the early 2000s, several blockbusters could compete with Hollywood fare. That is when Russian President Vladimir Putin came to power, and law enforcement agencies, including his alma mater, the Federal Security Service (FSB), began funding propaganda. In The Apocalypse Code, a 2007 knockoff of James Bond and Charlie’s Angels films, the world is saved by a female FSB officer in revealing clothes. The film cost $15m but grossed $7m and was panned by critics. Its creator, the non-profit Fund to Support Patriotic Films, whose trustees included security and defence officials, did not appear to care. “Profits are not our priority,” the fund’s head, Olesya Bykova, told this reporter in 2008. Instead, she said, her fund focused on something that could inspire “respect to people who represent our country, to security officers, to our traditions and love to our motherland”.

       " {'Title': 'Why are US Republicans pushing for aid to Israel but not Ukraine?',\n",
       "  'Date': '8 Nov 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Experts say a fractured Republican Party is increasingly turning away from Ukraine in favour of support for Israel. As wars continue to rage in both Ukraine and Gaza, another battle is playing out in the United States Congress: over which country should receive aid money. In recent months, congressional Republicans have expressed increasing scepticism towards approving more funds for the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as his country seeks to repel a full-scale Russian invasion. But that opposition has grown since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7, with some Republicans positioning aid for Israel and Ukraine as an either-or proposition. “Israel is facing [an] existential threat. Any funding for Ukraine should be redirected to Israel immediately,” Republican Senator Josh Hawley posted on social media two days after the war began. Experts say that disparate approach — with stronger Republican backing for aid to Israel than to Ukraine — signals the growing power of the party’s hard-right flank. “Omitting aid for Ukraine is a concession to the far right of the Republican Party,” Richard F Bensel, a government studies professor at Cornell University, told Al Jazeera. Ukraine, he added, “has neither the emotional appeal of a religious ally nor the geopolitical importance of Israel, and the differences between the two issues reflect deeper divisions within the Republican Party between secular rationalism and sectarian emotionalism”. The debate over foreign aid comes amid turmoil within the Republican caucus, which struggled last month to elect a speaker to lead the House of Representatives. After weeks of internal fighting, religious conservative Mike Johnson finally won the gavel on October 25, in an apparent victory for hardline and evangelical interests. One of Johnson’s first moves was to introduce a bill that included nearly $14.5bn in support for Israel but zero dollars for Ukraine. It passed the Republican-controlled House by a vote of 226 to 196, only to be shut down in the Democrat-led Senate on Tuesday. Robert Y Shapiro, a political science professor at Columbia University, said the failed bill points to the continued sway former President Donald Trump holds over the Republican Party. Trump is currently the Republican frontrunner in the 2024 presidential race. During his time in office, he championed an “America First” foreign policy that saw the US withdraw from certain international agreements, in favour of a more isolationist stance. “This [bill] is clearly a show for the Trump base of the Republican Party, which opposes anything related to Ukraine,” Shapiro said. Trump, he explained, has lingering resentment towards Ukraine. After all, questions over whether Trump illegally withheld military aid to Ukraine led to his first impeachment. And then there was Trump’s cosy relationship with Ukraine’s adversary, Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he praised on several occasions. Since leaving office, Trump has remained critical of aid to Ukraine. In campaign stops for his reelection bid, he called on Congress to cut off military assistance to the country, accusing it of paying “millions of dollars” to the “Biden crime family” — a reference to his Democratic rival, President Joe Biden. Trump is hardly the first leader to push for more isolationism in US foreign policy: The sentiment was particularly strong after World War I, as the country tried to disentangle itself from continued tensions in Europe. But Stephen Zunes, a professor of politics and international studies at the University of San Francisco, told Al Jazeera that isolationism is making a comeback. “Recent years have witnessed a growing segment of the Republican Party moving away from its more overtly imperialistic and interventionist foreign policy to a more isolationist foreign policy,” Zunes said. However, the strong Christian leanings in the Republican Party allow for a more easy embrace of aid requests for Israel. “An exception is made for Israel, in large part due to the strong influence of fundamentalist Christians who believe that the modern state of Israel is the manifestation of Biblical Israel and therefore is in God’s favour,” Zunes explained. Aid to Ukraine still has prominent supporters among the Republican Party, including Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell. He called for military assistance to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan to be packaged together, along with greater funds for US border security. “We view all of these problems as connected,” McConnell told reporters at an October 31 press conference. But US views overall are shifting towards the war in Ukraine, with Republican voters in particular retreating from their initial support for the embattled country. A Gallup poll released on November 2 found that 41 percent of Americans believe their country is “doing too much” to help Ukraine, up from 29 percent this June. The belief is most common among Republicans, 62 percent of whom agreed with that statement. Some experts point to the prevalence of war fatigue among the American public. The war in Ukraine has stretched on for months since its start in February 2022, arriving at a seeming deadlock. But the Israel-Hamas war is new. It was sparked on October 7 with a surprise attack from the Palestinian group Hamas, and it has continued over the last month with the steady Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip. The US public has responded with large-scale protests in favour of Israeli and Palestinian causes. One pro-Palestinian march on Saturday brought thousands of people to Washington, DC, flooding Freedom Plaza. “Part of [the issue] is that newer conflicts will get more attention than ongoing conflicts,” Zunes said. “Another is that the Gaza War is more violent. Israel has killed more Palestinian civilians during the past month than Russia has killed Ukrainian civilians in the past 20 months.” Zunes also noted that Israel “plays an important role in advancing US strategic interests in the greater Middle East”, making support for the country more pressing. With withering Republican support for Ukraine, Democrats have largely helmed the push to bundle aid for the two countries together. In October, President Biden called on Congress to approve a $105bn supplemental funding request, which included $61.4bn for Ukraine and $14.3bn for Israel. But as Congress approaches its November 17 deadline to pass budget legislation — or else risk a government shutdown — experts suspect Biden’s funding request is unlikely to pass. What’s more, the 2024 presidential race is heating up, with polls showing Biden and Trump neck and neck. Foreign aid will likely be one of many flashpoints. “We won’t see a compromise between Democrats and Republicans,” Shapiro, the Columbia professor, told Al Jazeera. “The Republicans will almost certainly ultimately come together in opposing all things Democratic in the 2024 election.” Bensel, meanwhile, spoke to the increasing polarisation across the political landscape. Not only does the Republican-controlled House butt heads with the president’s agenda, but it is also at odds with the Democratic majority in the Senate. “The disagreements between the administration and the House of Representatives — and between the two chambers of Congress — are clearly driven by the very serious partisan divisions in the nation at large,” Bensel said. That political impasse is not necessarily new, he added. “What is abnormal is the apparently irreconcilable split within the Republican Party in the House of Representatives.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'A missile has hit a civilian vessel in the Black Sea region, killing one and injuring four, the army says. Russia has fired a missile at a Liberia-flagged civilian ship entering a port in the Black Sea region of Odesa, according to the Ukrainian army. A harbour pilot was killed and four of the ship’s crew were injured in the attack on Wednesday. “The missile hit the structure of a civilian vessel flying the Liberian flag as it was entering the port,” the army said. “Three crew members, citizens of the Philippines, were injured, one of them was hospitalised. The pilot was killed and another port worker was injured,” it added. Since a United Nations-brokered deal guaranteeing safe passage for civilian ships fell through in July, both Kyiv and Moscow have ramped up military activity and attacks in the Black Sea. “Continuing the terror of civilian shipping, the enemy insidiously fired an Kh-31P anti-radar missile in the direction of one of the ports of Odesa region from tactical aircraft in the Black Sea,” the Ukrainian army said. The collapse of the UN-backed grain export deal prompted Moscow to warn that any ships entering Ukrainian ports could be viewed as potential military targets. Ukraine subsequently announced the launch of a new “humanitarian corridor” – a sea route for civilian ships – that avoids international waters. But Russia has continued to attack Ukraine’s grain-exporting ports and infrastructure. EU membership prospects On Wednesday, the European Union’s executive recommended opening formal membership talks with Ukraine, as soon as it meets final conditions, in a major show of support for Kyiv in its battle against Russia. “This is a strong and historic step that paves the way to a stronger EU with Ukraine as its member,” Ukrainian President\\xa0Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted on social media. Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine would still try to deliver battlefield results by the end of the year and that he remained sure Kyiv would eventually have success in the war despite difficulties at the front. Acknowledging the slow progress of Kyiv’s counteroffensive in the occupied south, in an interview by video link at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York, he also touted a Ukrainian battlefield plan for 2024 that he said he could not disclose. His tone contrasted with the gloomier assessment last week of his commander-in-chief who said the fighting now in its 21st month might be heading towards a deadlock and a war of attrition that could play into Russia’s hands.

Russia is trying to get back parts of defence systems it had exported in an attempt to restock for its invasion of Ukraine,\\xa0the Wall Street Journal has reported. In an article published on Wednesday, the US-based newspaper reported – citing three people with knowledge of the encounter – that Russian officials visited Cairo in April and asked Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to return more than 100 engines from Russian helicopters. The sources claimed Sisi gave the green light and the deliveries will likely begin in December. An Egyptian government spokesman declined to comment to the WSJ. Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify the claims. Cairo has maintained some arms trade ties with Russia, to which the US has acquiesced. According to the newspaper, Moscow has also contacted Pakistani, Belarusian and Brazilian officials to try to recover engines and transport helicopters its forces lost to Ukrainian defences early on in the war. “Russia spent decades building its arms trade,” one source said, according to the WSJ. “Now they’re going back in secret to their customers trying to buy back what they sold them.” As well as buying back weapons, Russia is understood to be stepping up domestic production. Russian officials have rejected repeated Western claims its supplies are shrinking and steered clear of announcing specifics regarding its arsenal and domestic production. The war in Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, and has claimed tens of thousands of lives – mostly soldiers on both sides, devastated the country, and sent diplomatic ties between the West and Moscow to historic lows. WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich is currently detained in Russia, accused of spying. He and his paper deny the allegations. In its report on Wednesday, the WSJ also alleged that Russia has received more munitions from partners, including North Korea – a claim made earlier this month by South Korea and denied by Pyongyang. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Russia officially pulled out of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), an international security pact that restricts the use of conventional weapons, saying NATO’s expansion has made such cooperation impossible. As for Ukraine’s weapons supplies, military analysts have said Kyiv’s counteroffensive has so far failed because the West is failing to send arms in an efficient manner. “Strategic objectives have not been achieved this year, and it’s hardly possible” in the remaining months, Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, told Al Jazeera. He blamed Western allies for months-long delays of weaponry and a reluctance to supply more sophisticated arms.               Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

The European Union’s executive has recommended opening formal membership talks with Ukraine, as soon as it meets final conditions, in a major show of support for Kyiv in its battle against Russia. “This is a strong and historic step that paves the way to a stronger EU with Ukraine as its member,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted on social media on Wednesday. “Our country must be in the European Union. Ukrainians deserve it both for their defence of European values and for the fact that even in times of full-scale war, we keep our word,” he said. The European Commission, which also paved the way for discussions to begin with Moldova, recommended that the talks should formally be launched once Ukraine satisfies remaining conditions related to reining in corruption, adopting a law on lobbying in line with EU standards and strengthening national minority safeguards. “Today is a historic day,” commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. “Ukraine continues to face tremendous hardship and tragedy provoked by Russia’s war of aggression, and yet the Ukrainians are deeply reforming their country.” Ukraine launched its bid to become part of the EU after Moscow’s invasion in February 2022 and was officially named a candidate to join in June that year. Former Soviet republic Moldova had applied at the same time as Ukraine. Moldovan President Maia Sandu thanked Brussels and said her country was “firmly on the path for EU membership and we will continue working relentlessly towards this goal”. The EU’s 27 leaders still have to sign off on the recommendations at a summit in December, and the membership process is contingent upon the completion of required reforms with regular progress assessments as part of a long and vigorous process. Brussels also suggested member states grant Georgia candidate status. “I rejoice with the people of Georgia,” Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili wrote online. Balkan country Bosnia and Herzegovina did not get approval yet again, having come short on expected membership criteria, von der Leyen said. Other EU hopefuls include Turkey, which began accession talks in 2005, but those are at a dead end. Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia are also stuck in negotiations. The war in Ukraine has breathed new life into the EU’s stalled push to take on new members as the bloc looks to keep Russian and Chinese influence at bay. The commission in June last year set Kyiv seven reform benchmarks to complete, including tackling corruption and curbing oligarch power, before talks should start. Von der Leyen said Ukraine had now completed “well over 90 percent of the necessary steps”. The positive signal from the EU provides a vital boost to Ukraine at a difficult time. However, whether EU countries will be ready by December to approve the talks with the war-torn country of more than 40 million people is uncertain.               Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'The G7 hopes to assure Ukraine of support amid the Gaza war as Russia says Western policies endanger the world. The Group of Seven (G7) has reiterated its unwavering support for Ukraine as the Israel-Hamas conflict threatens to take the focus off Russia’s invasion. However, Moscow remains defiant, claiming that Western “aggression” risks global catastrophe. The foreign ministers of the leading industrial democracies said on Wednesday that they had gathered in Japan seeking to “speak … with one clear voice” and forge a consensus amid two serious conflicts and other crises around the world. “Our steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine’s fight for its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity will never waver … we further call on China not to assist Russia in its war against Ukraine,” the ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union, said in a statement. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that amid the war in Gaza, his country’s continuing defence against the Russian invasion must not slip out of focus. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba joined the G7 meeting by video conference. With the war approaching its third year, Ukraine is braced for a Russian winter offensive targeting energy infrastructure, with more than 60 attacks in recent weeks, Ukraine’s energy ministry said. The Kremlin, meanwhile, warned on Wednesday that the West’s aggressive behaviour could lead to catastrophe. Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said that the “destructive” policies of the United States and its allies were increasing the risk that nuclear, chemical or biological weapons would be used. “The natural consequence of the United States’ destructive policies is the deterioration in the global security,” Patrushev said, according to state news agency TASS. “The risk that nuclear, chemical and biological weapons will be used is increasing,” Patrushev said. “The international arms control regime has been undermined,” he added, claiming that Ukraine had tried to attack three Russian nuclear power plants. “We have a doctrine where everything is clearly spelled out. There are no changes. This is confirmed by the president,” Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov said when asked to clarify Patrushev’s remarks. Patrushev also warned of a wider Western colonial agenda, claiming that more countries are falling victim to Western exploitation. The opening of formal EU membership talks was recommended for Moldova and Ukraine on Wednesday, with Georgia to be awarded candidate status. Patrushev said Moldova is “on a path to lose its sovereignty and risks becoming another victim of Western colonialism”. Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also joined the criticism, accusing the West of provoking crises in the global markets. He blamed boycotts on Russian energy and a self-serving rush to switch to green energy for hurting\\xa0global energy security. Meanwhile, he reported that efforts to renegotiate the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which allowed Ukrainian exports by sea, have broken down again. The deal, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey last year, allowed Ukraine to safely export grain and deliver much-needed grain all over the world. However, Russia withdrew in July, saying the arrangement was not delivering grain to the poorest countries, and discriminated against its own exports of grain and fertiliser. Since the deal was scrapped, Russia has concentrated fire on Ukrainian grain storage and port facilities.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Mikhail Filiponenko had been engaged in Luhansk’s pro-Russian separatist movement since 2014. Ukraine said it carried out a special operation to kill a Russia-backed politician who died as a car bomb exploded in eastern Ukraine. The assassination is the latest in a series of attacks against separatists and Moscow-installed officials in the Ukrainian regions to which the Kremlin lays claim. Mikhail Filiponenko, a deputy in the Russia-backed parliament in occupied Luhansk, was killed on Wednesday after an “explosive device detonated” in his car, his son told the Luhansk Information Centre news agency. Filiponenko, who had been engaged in Luhansk’s pro-Russian separatist movement since 2014, previously acted as one of the top commanders in the army of the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic. In September, he was voted into the regional assembly in a poll that sparked broad international condemnation. Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said it conducted the operation with resistance forces in Luhansk. “A special operation to eliminate Filiponenko was implemented jointly with representatives of the resistance movement. As a result of the morning explosion, Filiponenko died on the spot,” it said on the messaging app Telegram. Luhansk is one of four Ukrainian regions Russia said it annexed last year, despite not exerting full military control in the areas. Russian media shared photos of what they said was Filiponenko’s battered vehicle on the side of the road, with traces of blood on the seats. ☠️🧨 Explosão em carro mata ex-comandante da Milícia Popular de Lugansk Mikhail Filiponenko, deputado do Conselho da RPL, ex-comandante da Milícia Popular da república, morreu em resultado de uma explosão em seu carro, esclareceu o Centro de Informações de Lugansk. pic.twitter.com/kqrpch00hA — Sputnik Brasil (@sputnik_brasil) November 8, 2023  Several high-profile backers of Russia’s assault on Ukraine and Moscow-installed officials in territory seized by Russian forces have been attacked since the conflict started last February. Last month Oleg Tsaryov, a pro-Kremlin politician that Moscow was reportedly prepping to head a pro-Russian government in Kyiv, survived being shot in his hotel complex on the annexed peninsula of Crimea. Moscow has accused Ukrainian secret services of carrying out that and several other attacks, including the car bombing of nationalist Darya Dugina outside Moscow last year and the bombing of military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in a Saint Petersburg cafe in April. Kyiv has given no immediate comment after Wednesday’s bombing. Russia and Ukraine have been locked in a bloody 20-month war since Moscow sent troops to invade the neighbouring country in February 2022. There have since been hundreds of thousands of casualties on each side.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '7 Nov 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Ukraine hoped to unleash punishing counterattacks on invading Russian troops. Experts explain why the push did not live up to expectations. Kyiv, Ukraine – Referring to the Soviet puzzle video game, Alla says her husband kills Russian soldiers as though he is playing “human Tetris”. “A drone hangs in the sky, and he watches [them] crawl across the forest,” she told Al Jazeera. “And he kills them. And then they crawl again.” The war in Ukraine has turned Avdiivka, where Alla’s husband is stationed, into a maze of ruins, trenches and tunnels surrounded by burned-down fields and patches of forest studded with landmines, explosion craters and remnants of Russian soldiers and armoured vehicles. Avdiivka sits 20km (12 miles) north of separatist Donetsk, wedged deep into occupied areas. Ukraine has held it since 2014. But it is nearly surrounded, and Ukrainian forces may have to leave it after weeks of bombardment with 500kg (1,100-pound) gliding bombs and storms that killed thousands on both sides. The surrender may become a sobering, pessimistic end of this year’s counteroffensive campaign, that began in June along the crescent-shaped, 1,000km-long (621-mile) front line in eastern and southern Ukraine. Last year, Ukrainian forces liberated almost 75,000 sq km (30,000 sq miles), an area the size of the United Arab Emirates, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a think tank in Washington, DC. Kyiv had said it wanted to reach the Sea of Azov to cut the “land bridge” between the Russian mainland and annexed Crimea. But Russian forces spent months building defence lines and planting thousands of landmines across no-man’s land. They also rule the air and airwaves with their planes, Lancet kamikaze drones, and radio-jamming systems that paralyse and disorient Ukrainian unmanned vehicles. Meanwhile, the F-16 fighter jets the West pledged to supply will take months to arrive – and their future pilots will spend many more months on training. So far this year, Kyiv has lost some 487 square kilometres (188 sq miles), according to a calculation by The New York Times published in late September. The results are disappointing due to several factors, military analysts say. “Strategic objectives have not been achieved this year, and it’s hardly possible” in the remaining months, Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, told Al Jazeera. He blamed Western allies for months-long delays of weaponry and a reluctance to supply more sophisticated arms. “Weaponry should be supplied on time, not the way our allies are doing it,” he said. Ukrainian “generals asked [for certain arms] a year ago, but they still didn’t supply even the types of arms that had been agreed upon.” Ukrainian top brass have long complained about the delays that Western officials say are caused by logistical hurdles. Meanwhile, the war has morphed into WWI-like positional warfare that exhausts both sides in terms of manpower and economy. “This is not our war because resources-wise, economically, Russia looks stronger and has a four-fold advantage in manpower,” Romanenko said. Russia’s population stands at 143 million, but millions of Ukrainian nationals live in annexed Crimea and other occupied areas of eastern and southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s current population is between 29 and 33 million, according to different estimates. And even though men aged 18 to 60 are not allowed to leave Ukraine, and several waves of mobilisation had hundreds of thousands drafted, heavy losses have bled Ukrainian forces dry. “Obviously, there isn’t enough manpower,” Romanenko said. He said there should be tougher measures to register all men of fighting age and classify them according to their fitness for combat. Meanwhile, some younger Ukrainians dodge the draft any way they can. “I got a summons, it was stuck in my [apartment] door,” Boris, a 21-year-old university student in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. “I have kept it there for two months so that it looks like no one lives in the apartment.” Ukraine’s commander-in-chief reportedly admitted that the counteroffensive had reached a “stalemate”. “Just like in the first world war we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate,” he told The Economist on November 1. “There will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough.” Nikolay Mitrokhin, of Germany’s Bremen University, told Al Jazeera that Ukraine paid too dearly, with Western-supplied arms spent during “meaningless” frontal assaults on enemy lines. “A part of Western equipment burned down in meaningless attempts to break through that ended with the liberation of half a dozen ruined villages.” The counteroffensive brought with it huge casualties among Ukrainian servicemen – especially the Western-trained units that were withdrawn from the eastern towns of Bakhmut and Soledar\\xa0– Russia’s last sizeable territorial gains last year. While there are no reliable official figures of casualties, tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides are understood to have been killed in the war this year. “Russian defence ground down the attack brigades that had been trained for at least six months and for whose salvation Bakhmut and Soledar were abandoned,” Mitrokhin said. Meanwhile, the Kremlin managed to avoid the collapse of Russia’s economy. “Russia has used comprehensive stimuli of investment, credit and budget – from affordable mortgages to the military-industrial complex,” Kyiv-based analyst Alexey Kushch told Al Jazeera. Moscow’s strategy of affordable credits and “replacing import” in response to Western sanctions triggered the mushrooming of domestic businesses, he said. In comparison with Russia, Ukraine’s economy is “hanging by a thread of foreign aid”, Kushch said. “There are no programmes of internal development, monetary policies are aimed at restriction of domestic credits,” he said. The economic backbone of Russia is hydrocarbon exports, and it can only be broken if the “entire world will stop buying Russian oil and gas,” said Sergey Bizyukin, an exiled opposition activist from the western city of Ryazan. “And yes, defence factories in Ryazan, where the technological base has traditionally been strong, work at a full throttle, and there’s only a lack of workforce,” he told Al Jazeera. But regardless of how small Kyiv’s gains are, they “shouldn’t be underestimated” – in the words of Rybar, a pro-Russian Telegram channel with 1.2m subscribers. Ukrainian forces are expanding their toehold on the left bank of the Dnipro river in the southern Kherson region, a gateway to Crimea, it said. Supported by swarms of drones, Ukrainians ferried armoured vehicles and some 300 servicemen to the village of Krynki earlier this month, Rybar said. “Krynki is ours,” Ukrainian war veteran Yevgen Dikyi said in televised remarks.

       " {'Title': 'Blinken seeks G7 unity on Israel-Hamas war',\n",
       "  'Date': '7 Nov 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Top diplomats of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, the US and the EU are gathering amid two serious conflicts. After a whirlwind tour of the Middle East, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has shifted his intense diplomacy on the Israel-Hamas war to Asia with an appeal for the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial democracies to forge consensus on how to deal with the crisis. As he and his G7 counterparts began two days of talks in Japan, Blinken said it was important for the group to show unity – as it has over Russia’s war in Ukraine and other major issues – and prevent existing differences on Gaza from deepening. “This is a very important moment as well for the G7 to come together in the face of this crisis and to speak, as we do, with one clear voice,” Blinken told Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa, shortly after talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The devastating monthlong conflict in Gaza and efforts to ease the dire humanitarian impacts of the Israeli assault will be a major focus of the meeting. Yet with the Russia-Ukraine war, fears North Korea may be readying a new nuclear test, and concerns about China’s increasing global assertiveness, it is far from the only crisis on the agenda. In Tokyo, Blinken and foreign ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Italy will be seeking common ground in part to prevent the Gaza war from further destabilising already shaky security in the broader Middle East and seeking to maintain existing positions on other matters. Israel, after a surprise attack on October 7 by Hamas – the group that rules Gaza, and that on October 7 and in its aftermath killed more than 1,400 people in Israel – has waged a monthlong assault on Gaza, relentlessly bombarding the enclave and sending in ground forces for the first time since 2014. Israeli attacks have during this time killed more than 10,000 Palestinians, more than a third of them children, according to Gaza’s officials, while displacing 1.5 million people and decimating much of the territory’s infrastructure.      An early consensus on Gaza appeared to be building as at least four of the G7 members made statements in favour of a strong common stance. Kishida said “the unity of G7 is needed more than ever with the situation in Israel and Palestine, the situation in Ukraine, and the challenges in the Indo-Pacific region,” his office said in a statement, adding that the prime minister “highly appreciates the leadership and diplomatic efforts by the Biden administration concerning this issue”. “You have our utmost support,” Kamikawa told Blinken, the top diplomat in the administration of United States President Joe Biden. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that “as G7 countries, we are making clear that Israel has the right and the duty to protect its population and its people in the framework of international law”. She said that she has been discussing with many partners “how we can finally get humanitarian ceasefires off the ground, in terms of time and also geographically”. United Kingdom Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told journalists his government only supports a time and geographically specific “humanitarian pause” and not a wider ceasefire. “Firstly, we have seen and heard absolutely nothing that makes us believe that Hamas leadership is serious about [a] ceasefire,” he said, adding that a ceasefire would hamper Israel’s ability to defend itself. The US has provided firm backing to Israel, offering it a $14.5bn military aid package amid the war and voting with it against a “humanitarian truce” at the United Nations General Assembly last month. France voted in favour of the “humanitarian truce” while all other G7 member countries abstained. Blinken has said Washington is working “very aggressively” to expand aid for trapped civilians in Gaza. “I think we will see in the days ahead that the assistance can expand in significant ways,” Blinken said on Monday, without providing details. Another focus of the G7 meet-up will be Russia’s war in Ukraine, which has lost global attention due to the bloodshed in Gaza. The G7 was expected to stick to firm language condemning Moscow and reaffirm its commitment to Ukraine. “Our commitment to continue strict sanctions against Russia and strong support for Ukraine has not wavered at all, even as the situation in the Middle East intensifies,” Japan’s FM Kamikawa told a news conference before the meeting. The gathering will include a virtual meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. The G7 has been at the forefront of sanctions on Russia since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In the latest move aimed at ramping up economic pressure on Russia, the group is considering proposals to impose sanctions on Russian diamonds. UK Foreign Secretary Cleverly is set to meet Kamikawa on the sidelines of the gathering to discuss intensifying military cooperation with Japan under a new pact that allows their countries’ militaries to enter each other’s territories for joint exercises. These talks, also featuring UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps and Japan’s Defence Minister Minoru Kihara, are likely to include expanding joint exercises and cooperation in new areas such as space and cybersecurity, based on the Japan-UK Hiroshima Accord reached in May. Japan in December announced a new mid- to long-term security strategy to build up its security and defence – including counterstrike capability – in a significant shift from its self-defence-only principle adopted after the last world war. Foreign ministers of five Central Asian countries are also expected to participate online in the Tokyo gathering, as the grouping aims to deepen ties to the region amid the Ukraine war. Ministers of former Soviet nations Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan will join for talks on Wednesday. G7 leaders have recently increased outreach to these resource-rich countries, with French President Emmanuel Macron making stops in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan last week during his Central Asia tour, and Japanese PM Kishida planning a similar trip in 2024.

       " {'Title': 'Will UAE hurt Russia with export controls to please the US amid Israel war?',\n",
       "  'Date': '7 Nov 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Any export control measures by the UAE will be to shore up support from the US in case the Israel-Gaza war expands. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been in the crosshairs of the United States and the European Union for its continued links to Russia, frustrating the West’s efforts to squeeze Moscow economically in response to its war on Ukraine. But now, some possible adjustments in Abu Dhabi’s foreign policy could slightly change the picture amid rising concerns that Israel’s war on Gaza could spread across the region. In early September, representatives from the United Kingdom, EU and US visited the UAE to voice their concerns about the Gulf country’s links to Russia. Specifically, these Western governments have tried to prevent the Russians from accessing certain dual-use products such as computer chips and electronic components that can be used to strengthen the Russian war machine. Earlier this year, Washington warned the UAE, Oman, and Turkey against evading sanctions and export controls imposed on Moscow last year. Then in April, the US imposed sanctions on two UAE-based entities: Aeromotus Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Trading LLC and Hulm Al Sahra Electric Devices Trading. According to the Treasury Department, Aeromotus had sent several drones and robotics technology to Russian importers following the outbreak of the ongoing war in Ukraine. Washington sanctioned Hulm Al Sahra for allegedly sending roughly $190,000 worth of semiconductors, which were from the US and subject to US export controls, as well as machinery, electronics and optics to Russian companies in the second half of 2022. Shortly after the Western officials’ September visit to the UAE, Bloomberg News reported that Emirati authorities were considering introducing export licenses on certain technologies, including semiconductors. Abu Dhabi has yet to impose these measures. Any such move, should it happen, will be not only because of mounting pressures from the West, but also because of growing threats of the Israel-Hamas war spilling into other parts of the Middle East. In that scenario, the UAE would want to shore up ties with its ultimate security guarantor, the US, according to experts. “If the UAE does introduce export licenses, it would be an indicator that it sees the costs of not complying with Western demands as exceeding the benefits of at least some of its trade with Russia,” said Mark Katz, a professor at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government, in an interview with Al Jazeera. “It would also be an indicator that the UAE does not want to damage its relations with the US, especially when the possibility of a wider Middle Eastern conflict including Iran is brewing and the UAE would want to have American protection against Tehran,” he said. With the COP28 set to kick off later this month, the UAE wants as much calm as possible in the neighbourhood.      Even if the UAE introduces any export control licenses, it is not clear how much of a problem this would create in Emirati-Russian relations. “Moscow is likely to understand that the UAE would be making this move under pressure from the West. Further, this move might only reduce, not eliminate, UAE-Russia cooperation. Moscow would want to preserve what cooperation it can with the UAE,” Katz said. Perhaps such export licenses could help advance Abu Dhabi’s interests – both in terms of its reputation as a trade hub in the Middle East and its national security concerns regarding the Russia-Iran entente. “Introducing the export licenses would help reinforce the idea that the UAE is a reliable place to do business,” Gordon Gray, a former US ambassador to Tunisia, told Al Jazeera. “The UAE has strong political and economic incentives to maintain good relations with the United States and the European Union. It is also undoubtedly suspicious of the burgeoning military alliance between Russia and Iran, and would want to protect its national security by preventing dual-use goods from ending up in Iranian hands.” Officials in the UAE have concerns about Moscow’s deepening partnership with Tehran – partly because of the non-state actors that Tehran sponsors and partly because of its drone and ballistic missile activities – and are concerned about their potential to exacerbate the Middle East’s security crises. Yet, taking cues from the West when it comes to relations with Russia would not be without certain risks for the UAE. Russia has reportedly been sourcing drones and other weapons systems for its war in Ukraine from Iran. From Abu Dhabi’s standpoint, this dependence, combined with lower levels of cooperation with the UAE, might result in Russia tilting more towards Tehran when it comes to contentious issues in Emirati-Iranian relations, which could be problematic for the Emiratis. “Moscow might not be above holding this out as a possibility to deter the UAE from further complying with Western sanctions against Russia,” he said. However, some experts question if Abu Dhabi would actually introduce such export licenses to curry favour with Washington and other Western capitals. “The UAE and other Gulf states have not been too enthusiastic about harming their relations with Russia,” Imad Harb, the director of Research and Analysis at Arab Center Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera. “If indeed the UAE imposes these controls, the decision would be for geopolitical reasons, specifically to appear that it abides by US and EU wishes. But even if it imposes controls, there are ways of going around them by companies and individuals who are most concerned about their business and commercial interests.” According to Harb, the introduction of these export licenses probably won’t have too much of a negative effect on Abu Dhabi’s relationship with Moscow as he pointed to the two countries ability to work around such controls. “The UAE can always arrange to sell the technology through Iran which has good relations with Russia and will probably be eager to help Moscow circumvent any sanctions,” he told Al Jazeera.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says discussions about the fate of scheduled 2024 elections are irresponsible as the country is locked in a war with invading Russian forces. Speaking in a video address on Monday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine must remain focused on its military challenges and stay united. “We all understand that now, in wartime, when there are many challenges, it is utterly irresponsible to engage in topics related to an election in such a frivolous manner,” Zelenskyy said. “We need to recognise that this is a time for defence, a time for battle, upon which the fate of the state and its people depend. … I believe that elections are not appropriate at this time.”      Ukraine is currently under martial law as it battles Russian forces, whom Kyiv hopes to expel from its territory. But as the war drags on, Zelenskyy has considered whether a special provision could be invoked to hold elections. Over the weekend, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the president was considering the positives and negatives of holding elections during a time when large swathes of the country remain affected by fighting. As Ukraine battles to maintain the support of Western allies such as the United States, some, such as US Senator Lindsey Graham, have called for the elections to proceed as planned to demonstrate Ukraine’s commitment to democracy. Zelenskyy also played down concerns recently that the war with Russia has reached a deadlock.      “Time has passed, people are tired, …. but this is not a stalemate,” Zelenskyy said at a news conference on Saturday in Kyiv with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “No one among our partners is pressuring us to sit down with Russia, talk to it and give it something,” he added.

       "  'Text': 'The IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee on October 12 for violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine by recognising sports bodies in illegally annexed territories. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has registered an appeal filed by the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) against the decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to suspend its membership, the independent judicial body said. The challenge arose over the IOC’s suspension of the ROC following the ROC decision to include as its members some regional sport organisations which are under the authority of the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of Ukraine. “In its appeal to the CAS, the ROC requests that the Challenged Decision be set aside and that it be reinstated as a NOC recognised by the IOC, benefitting from all rights and prerogatives granted by the Olympic Charter,” CAS said in a release. “The CAS arbitration proceedings have commenced. In accordance with the Code of Sports-related Arbitration (the CAS Code), the arbitration rules governing CAS procedures, the parties are exchanging written submissions and the Panel of arbitrators that will decide the matter is being constituted.” The ROC was banned with immediate effect on October 12 for recognising regional organisations from four territories annexed from Ukraine, the IOC said. The IOC added that the ROC would not be eligible for any funding after it recognised earlier this month Olympic Councils from the regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhia – but that this would not affect any Russian athletes competing as neutrals.      Russian President Vladimir Putin later accused the IOC of using the Olympic Games as a political tool. “Thanks to some of the leaders of the modern International Olympic Committee, we learned that an invitation to the Games is not an unconditional right of the best athletes, but a kind of privilege, and can be earned not by sporting results, but by political gestures that have nothing to do with sport at all,” Putin told the Russia-Sporting Power conference in the Urals city of Perm. “And that the Games themselves can be used as an instrument of political pressure against people who have nothing to do with politics. And as gross, and in fact racist, ethnic discrimination.” Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, which it calls a “special military operation”, has triggered multiple sporting sanctions, including exclusion from international football. The CAS panel’s decision will be final and binding, with the exception of the parties’ right to file an appeal to the Swiss Federal Tribunal within 30 days on limited grounds. The sport court said the arbitration proceedings had already begun with both parties exchanging written submissions before a panel of arbitrators is created. “At this time, it is not possible to indicate a time frame for the issuance of the decision,” it added.

       "  'Text': 'Russian forces have bombarded Ukraine’s port city of Odesa with missiles and drones. Four missiles and 22 attack drones were launched from the occupied region of Crimea of Ukraine at the Black Sea port late on Sunday, Ukraine’s air force reported on Monday. The attacks injured at least eight people, destroyed grain, and damaged the 124-year-old Odesa Fine Arts Museum. “Fifteen Shaheds and one Kh-59 air guided missile were shot down,” the Ukrainian air force said, referring to the Iranian-designed kamikaze unmanned aerial vehicle. Ukrainian Presidential Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak posted images on social media of the aftermath of the strike, vowing retribution for the attack. “This is their despicable answer to the reality – the Ukrainian Crimea will be demilitarised, without the Black Sea fleet and military bases of the Russians,” he said. Ukraine has recently ramped up strikes on the Russian naval base at Sevastopol. Meanwhile, Russian air attacks have intensified in recent weeks, with infrastructure a particular target ahead of the winter. Odesa, Ukraine’s main grain port, has also been targeted since earlier in the year when Moscow pulled out of a deal that allowed Ukrainian grain exports through the Black Sea. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said 20 residential buildings, the Odesa Fine Arts Museum and infrastructure facilities were damaged. A warehouse and trucks with grain caught fire, which was promptly extinguished. The museum, where walls and windows were damaged, housed before the war more than 10,000 pieces of art, including paintings by some of the best-known Russian and Ukrainian artists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. “On November 6, the Odesa National Art Museum turns 124 years old,” Oleh Kiper, governor of the Odesa region, of which the Odesa city is the administrative centre, said on the Telegram messaging app. “On the eve of November 6, the Russians ‘congratulated’ our architectural monument with a missile that hit nearby.” Eight people were injured during the attack.

       "  'Text': 'President Volodymyr Zelenskyy promises ‘complete truth’ after at least 20 soldiers killed in Russian missile attack. Ukraine has begun a criminal investigation after a group of soldiers attending an “award ceremony” not far from the front line in the southern Zaporizhia region were killed in a Russian missile attack. At least 20 soldiers were reported to have been killed in the incident on Friday in Zarichne, according to local media. Zaporizhia Governor Yuriy Malashko said nine civilians were also injured in the attack on the village, which is about 16km (10 miles) from the front line. “This is a tragedy that could have been avoided,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a speech late on Sunday. “A criminal investigation has been registered into the tragedy,” he added, saying the intention was to uncover the “complete truth” about what happened to ensure such incidents were not repeated. The Ukrainian Armed Forces confirmed on Saturday that several soldiers from its 128th Mountain Assault Brigade had been killed in a missile strike the day before, but did not provide casualty figures. “[Russia] fired an Iskander-M missile at the personnel of the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade, killing the soldiers and causing injuries of varying severity to local residents,” the army said. Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said in a social media statement the same day that he had ordered a “full investigation” into what had happened. Zelenskyy said Umerov had briefed him on the measures taken to clarify the circumstances of the attack, who was specifically involved and what orders were given. The New York Times, citing a military official who was not named because they were not authorised to speak to the media, said that any investigation was likely to focus on how Russia had found out about the event and been enabled to attack it. By holding the ceremony in the open, senior brigade members appeared to have breached military regulations, the official added. One Ukrainian soldier said on social media that 22 people from the brigade had been killed, criticising commanders for having held the ceremony. The event was organised to commemorate Artillery Day, which took place on Friday. “Everyone is writing that ‘Heroes died’. Although it is more appropriate to write ‘Heroes became victims’,” soldier Ivan Savytskyy said. “They became victims of military rudimentary traditionalism in its worst form,” he said. In its daily updates on battlefield developments, the Russian defence ministry said only that Russian forces had “inflicted fire” on a unit of Ukraine’s assault brigade in Zaporizhia, killing as many as 30 soldiers.      Russia and Ukraine have often underestimated their own military casualties in the 20-month-long war and exaggerated the losses they claim to have inflicted on each other. Ukraine’s western Zakarpattia region, where the 128th assault brigade is based, will observe a three-day mourning period from Monday, local Governor Viktor Mykyta said. “Our heroes are alive as long as the memory of them and their deeds lives on,” he said. Amid little apparent movement along the nearly 1,000km (620 mile) front line, Zelenskyy has rejected suggestions that the conflict is at a deadlock, urging allies to continue their support even as the Israel-Gaza war draws increasing attention. In his statement on Sunday, Zelenskyy sought to reassure Ukrainians about the conflict. “When we go through weeks like this, filled with pain and difficult discussions, it is important for people to understand that what weighs on their hearts is seen, and the necessary changes will be made,” the president said. “This applies to many things, from negligence that can occur to the Soviet legacy and the terrible bureaucracy that prevents Ukraine and many in our defence forces from realising their potential correctly and effectively.” Zelenskyy promised that the investigation into the attack would provide “honest answers” for the soldiers’ families as well as the wider Ukrainian society.

       "  'Text': 'Crimea’s Russian-installed chief says downed missile fragments had hit a dry dock and that there were no casualties. Ukraine’s armed forces said they hit marine and port infrastructure at a shipyard in the port city of Kerch on the eastern coast of Russian-occupied Crimea. Since launching its counteroffensive against Moscow’s forces this summer, Kyiv has ramped up attacks on the Black Sea peninsula that Russia seized in 2014. The peninsula’s Russian-installed chief said on Saturday that downed missile fragments had hit a dry dock and that there were no casualties. Ukraine had “implemented successful strikes on marine and port infrastructure of the ‘Zalyv’ factory in the temporarily occupied city of Kerch,” the Department for Strategic Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a Telegram post, giving no further details. “I hope another ship has followed the Moskva!” Mykola Oleshchuk, commander of Ukraine’s Air Force, said in a Telegram post, referring to the Russian Black Sea Fleet flagship sunk by Ukrainian missiles on April 14, 2022. Oleshchuk said cruise missiles struck the infrastructure at Zalyv – which is now named BE Butoma – “where one of the most modern Russian Navy ships was stationed, a Kalibr cruise missile carrier”. He said he was “awaiting official confirmation of the results”. Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-installed governor of Crimea, said air defence systems had been in action around a Kerch shipyard named after BE Butoma. “Fragments of downed missiles fell onto territory of one of the dry docks,” Aksyonov said in a Telegram post. “There were no casualties.” Meanwhile, Russian news agencies cited the Russian Ministry of Defence confirming that Ukraine hit a shipyard in Kerch with 15 cruise missiles, damaging one ship. It added that air defence systems destroyed 13 of the Ukraine-launched missiles. The Reuters and AFP news agencies said it was not possible to verify the Russian and Ukrainian statements, nor social media posts including videos of missile activity as well as fire and smoke that the posts said was rising from the same location the Ukrainian military mentioned. Military analyst and journalist Andriy Tsaplienko said in a Telegram post that one of Russia’s most modern ships, a small cruise missile carrier launched in 2021, the Askold, was damaged in the attack, according to what he described as preliminary information.

       "  'Text': 'The Ukrainian leader says the war between Israel and Hamas has drawn attention away from them, adding that is ‘Russia’s goal’.\\xa0 \\xa0 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has denied that Ukraine’s war with Russia had reached a “stalemate”, pushing back at suggestions Western leaders were lobbying for peace talks. The sprawling front line between the two warring sides has barely moved in almost a year, with one senior Ukrainian official warning this week that the conflict was deadlocked. “Time has passed, people are tired … But this is not a stalemate,” Zelenskyy told a news conference on Saturday in Kyiv with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The Ukrainian leader also rejected the idea that Western countries were putting pressure on Kyiv to enter negotiations with Russia, amid reports US and EU officials had discussed what such talks would entail. “No one among our partners is pressuring us to sit down with Russia, talk to it, and give it something,” he said. Such pressure existed before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and at the beginning of the fighting, but “today, none of the EU leaders or the US are putting pressure on me to sit down with Russia, negotiate and give Russia anything. There will be no such thing,” he added. Zelenskyy expressed irritation at media reports about pressure to negotiate, saying he had no idea where those claims came from. At the same time, he emphasised that he would always act in accordance with the will of the Ukrainian people. With the war now in its 20th month and Ukraine struggling to gain ground in its counteroffensive, Zelenskyy has routinely met Western leaders in a bid to stave off fatigue with the conflict. Zelenskyy said the war between Israel and Hamas had also drawn attention away from Ukraine, and said that this was “Russia’s goal”. “Of course, it’s clear that the war in the Middle East, this conflict, is taking away the focus,” Zelenskyy said. “We have already been in very difficult situations when there was almost no focus on Ukraine,” he said, but added, “I am absolutely sure we will overcome this challenge.” Ukraine’s backers, including the United States, have maintained they are ready to support Kyiv with military and financial support for as long as it takes to defeat Russia.

Ukrainian forces have killed at least nine people and wounded nine others in strikes on the Russian-occupied part of the southern Kherson region, the region’s Russia-installed authorities have said. The strikes on Friday struck an employment centre in Chaplynka, a town about 100 kilometres (62 miles) southeast of the regional capital Kherson, the region’s Moscow-appointed Governor Vladimir Saldo said. “As of now, nine dead have been pulled out from under the rubble as well as nine who are badly injured,” Saldo was quoted as saying by Russian state television. Moscow-backed official Konstantin Basyuk accused Kyiv of attacking civilian infrastructure in Chaplynsky, including the local pensions office and jobs centre. Ukrainian officials and Ukrainian media have not confirmed the attacks. Al Jazeera could not independently confirm the strikes or any resulting casualties or damage. Russia captured the Kherson region shortly after it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but has since abandoned the region’s main town and other centres on the west bank of the Dnipro River. Friday’s reported strikes came as Kyiv is mounting a counteroffensive to retake territory from Russian forces, focused on the south of the country.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Meloni discussed issues such as the Ukraine war and migration with a Russian comedian posing as an African official. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that her chief diplomatic adviser has resigned, after she was tricked by a prank phone call in which she discussed the war in Ukraine and migration. Meloni said on Friday that Francesco Talo, who previously served as Italy’s ambassador to NATO and Israel, had stepped down over the fiasco. “This matter was not handled well, we are all sorry, Ambassador [Francesco] Talo took responsibility for it,” Meloni said. In a call in September, supposedly with a high-level official from the African Union, Meloni made stark comments about several topics, saying that Italy was not receiving adequate support to crack down on migration and that there was international “fatigue” over the war in Ukraine.      The prime minister’s office later confirmed that the caller was not, in fact, an African Union official, but a Russian comedian who managed to fool them. Meloni blamed her staff for failing to adequately screen the caller after comments from the conversation were released online earlier this week. She said that she had “a doubt” about the identity of the caller but “no certainty”. The opposition Democratic Party had asked Meloni to inform parliament about the incident, charging that it raised questions about national security. The Italian leader also reiterated her country’s support for Ukraine on Friday, saying that comments about fatigue over the war are “nothing new”. “We have taken a very clear [pro-Ukraine] position and perhaps this is also why [Russians] call us,” she told a news conference, adding that there was no evidence that the call was part of a propaganda campaign. It is not the first time that Russian pranksters Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexei Stolyarov, known as Vovan and Lexus, have successfully fooled powerful leaders. Previous victims of their antics include former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Polish President Andrzej Duda.

Russia has launched dozens of drone attacks and fired shells and missiles against civilian infrastructure, Ukraine reports. Kyiv said two dozen Russian drones and a missile were downed overnight as concern grows that Moscow is once again targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure ahead of winter. Officials in Kharkiv reported civilian targets were hit by shelling and drone attacks. The General Staff of Ukraine’s military said Russian drones targeted several areas across Ukraine and were launched from Russia’s Kursk region and the Primorsk-Akhtarsk area. “As a result of combat operations, in cooperation with the defence forces of Ukraine, 24 attack bpla ‘Shahed-136/131’ [drones] and one controlled aviation missile were destroyed,” the statement said, using the acronym for “bezpilotniy letayuschiy apparat”, or “pilotless flying equipment”. Police in Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine reported that at least 10 Russian drones hit civilian infrastructure and triggered multiple fires in the city and shelling also damaged buildings. “As a result of the drone strikes, a local school was attacked, causing a fire that destroyed the roof and two of the building’s floors. A residential building, a service station and an administrative building were also on fire due to shelling,” the police officials added. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said the fires were being brought under control. While no casualties have been reported so far, Kharkiv police officials said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app that doctors have diagnosed three residents with “an acute reaction to stress”. The overnight raids are part of a recent rise in Russian attacks. More than 100 settlements in eastern Ukraine, including Kharkiv, were targeted on Wednesday, the heaviest day of shelling so far in 2023. Local authorities in Kharkiv said overnight shelling in the city on Wednesday killed one person. Ukraine and its partners in the West worry that Russia could try to replicate a strategy it followed last winter, squeezing Ukraine by targeting energy infrastructure as temperatures fall. Last winter, Russia repeatedly attacked civilian infrastructure far from the front lines, leaving millions of Ukrainians without power, heat and water for days at a time. “We are strengthening air defence and mobile fire groups,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the social media platform X.

       "  'Date': '3 Nov 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Sweeping new measures target entities including in China, Turkey and UAE in bid to cut off Russia’s supply chain. The United States has announced new sanctions covering some 130 new entities, including firms in China, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, for allegedly supplying Russia’s military with much-needed components and technology and abetting its ongoing war in Ukraine. “Russia is dependent on willing third-country individuals and entities to resupply its military and perpetuate its heinous war against Ukraine, and we will not hesitate in holding them accountable,” Secretary of the Treasury Jane Yellen\\xa0said in a statement on Thursday. The new measures target critical supply chains that have otherwise allowed Russia to circumvent international sanctions and export controls by exploiting “otherwise legitimate economic relationships” with China, Turkey, and the UAE. These loopholes allow entities in the three countries to send Russia “high-priority dual-use goods” such as vehicle parts or encryption software that can be used by civilians or the military. In a move welcomed by Ukraine, the latest sanctions mark the first time Washington has moved against the production of Russia’s Lancet suicide drones. Ukrainian soldiers say the drone – an angular grey tube with two sets of four wings – has emerged as an increasing threat on the front lines. In his nightly video address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the measures as “just what is needed”. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, agreed. “I am very pleased that … restrictions are being tightened against companies associated with the military-industrial complex of the Russian Federation … ,” Yermak wrote on the Telegram messaging app. The new Treasury sanctions also target Russia’s domestic industrial base, which, the Treasury said, had been reorientated from “producing goods for the Russian people to attempting to ensure that the war machine can sustain itself”. Separately on Thursday, the US Department of State added 100 new sanctions targeting Russia’s energy, metals and mining sectors, defence procurement and “those involved in supporting the Russian government’s war effort and other malign activities”. The Commerce Department, meanwhile, also blacklisted 12 Russian companies and another from Uzbekistan that is says helped Moscow acquire critical drone technology. The US, European Union and other countries have already sanctioned hundreds of Russian individuals and entities since Moscow’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Further sanctions have also targeted its economy, freezing overseas assets, restricting exports, and otherwise making the cost of doing business in Russia extremely challenging and expensive. Yellen said the “global sanctions coalition” had “choked off Russia’s access to key inputs for its military-industrial complex and has undermined the Kremlin’s ability to wage its unprovoked war”. Despite the sanctions, Russia’s economy is expected to grow 1.5 percent this year, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as countries like China, Turkey and India have provided Moscow with a critical economic lifeline.

Ukraine’s interior minister has said that more than 100 settlements have come under fire in 24 hours, marking the heaviest day of Russian shelling this year. In a statement on social media, Ukrainian Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said that Russia had unleashed a barrage of millions of shells on cities across the eastern regions of the country. “Over the last 24 hours, the enemy shelled 118 settlements in 10 regions,” Klymenko said on Wednesday. “This is the highest number of cities and villages that have come under attack since the start of the year,” he said.      Russia’s wave of strikes turned some towns and villages to rubble. Local authorities said that overnight shelling in the city of Kharkiv, near the border with Russia, killed one person, with another also killed in southeastern Kherson. A Russian drone strike on the southern city of Nikopol also killed a 59-year-old woman and injured four people. Kyiv reported that a Russian strike on an oil refinery in Kremenchuk had caused a fire that took hours to extinguish, but resulted in no casualties. Ukraine and its partners in the West, such as the United States, worry that Russia could squeeze Ukraine by targeting energy infrastructure as winter approaches. In an interview published by the British outlet The Economist on Wednesday, Ukrainian top general Valery Zaluzhny said that the conflict is moving towards a state of attrition, and that Ukraine will need new technology and larger army reserves to meet its goals. While Western supporters of Ukraine had hoped that a much-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive would result in large territorial gains, Zaluzhny said in the interview that there would be no “deep and beautiful breakthrough”.

       "  'Date': '1 Nov 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Russia throws vast numbers of poorly supported troops into a new meat grinder, Ukrainian officials say. Russia has doubled down on a campaign to capture the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka during the 88th week of its war in what appears to be a repeat of its year-long campaign to capture nearby Bakhmut, which fell in May. As in Bakhmut, the Russian tactics have consisted of waves of infantry attacks that Ukrainian commanders said would soon become denser, and as in Bakhmut, Russian forces were suffering large losses of men and equipment. The Russian military is mounting efforts to retake the initiative in other places on the eastern front as well. The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Russia has “significantly strengthened” its forces in Bakhmut and switched from defence to offence. Ukrainian forces have had the Russians in retreat there in recent months as they tried to encircle the captured town. They retook commanding heights north of Bakhmut in July, from which they’ve been shelling Russian positions. During the past week, they advanced past a railway line that runs 10km (6.2 miles) southwest of Bakhmut, meaning Russian forces can’t use it to resupply their front lines. Russian forces tried to advance from several directions towards Kupiansk in the Luhansk region, Syrskyi said. Ukrainian southern forces spokesman Oleksandr Shtupun estimated on Thursday that 5,000 Russians had been killed or wounded two weeks into the effort to capture Avdiivka and Moscow had lost about 400 armoured vehicles there and in Mariinka, farther south along the eastern front. That high rate of attrition continued in the past week, according to Ukraine. Its armed forces reported 660 Russians killed on Saturday across the front in 70 combat clashes, 10 of them in Avdiivka. Two days later, they said they killed 680 Russian soldiers. Shtupun said 500 of those casualties were in the Avdiivka area over 30 assaults. Russia is apparently able to replenish its numbers. The commander of the Russian “Arbat” Separate Guards Special Purpose Battalion, which is serving in Avdiivka, told a Russian reporter that fighters from the Wagner mercenary group are now among its ranks, an observation backed by a Ukrainian source. Wagner fighters were largely responsible for the capture of Bakhmut but were taken off the front lines because of military disagreements between the late Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, and the Russian Ministry of Defence. Their recruitment is likely to strengthen the quality of Russian forces. Russian National Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev said nearly 385,000 people entered service with the Russian armed forces this year. There may be worse to come.      Shtupun said Russia was training Storm-Z assault troops to deploy in Avdiivka. Storm-Z soldiers are recruited in prisons and are thought to receive only rudimentary training and equipment but are believed to be ruthless in close-quarters combat. Ukrainians refer to such waves of infantry with poor mechanised and air support as “meat assaults”. Retired Ukrainian Colonel Petro Chernyk said Russia could potentially call on up to 3 million former conscripts trained in basic combat and, despite the fact that Ukraine has “destroyed” about 25,000 Russian soldiers a month, these were always immediately replaced. “The enemy should not be underestimated strategically. They have an extremely large number of small arms in their warehouses, and the last battles for Avdiivka and Bakhmut showed that they will use large infantry [columns]. Therefore, any information that Russia is currently running out of mobilisation resources is absolute nonsense,” Ukraine’s armed forces website Armyinform quoted Chernyk as saying. Both sides appeared to be scraping the bottom of the barrel for ordnance. The Bloomberg news agency quoted unnamed sources as saying that the European Union had supplied only a third of the one million shells it has promised Ukraine by April. While Ukraine’s allies made new pledges of hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment in the past week, it appeared that not all were immediately deliverable. The New York Times reported that the US military was looking into marrying Soviet-era air defence launchers with modern Western missiles that are accurate and effective. These so-called FrankenSAM hybrid systems are an effort to make use of readily available components to enrich Ukraine’s air defences. In the same spirit, Russia was reportedly upgrading its gliding bombs – the FAB-250, FAB-500 and FAB-1500 – to use laser guidance, which improved their accuracy from 50 metres (55 yards) to 5 metres (5.5 yards). The smallest of these bombs reportedly carries 99kg (218lb) of explosives and has a damage radius of 120 metres (130 yards) while the largest packs 675kg (1,500lb) of explosives and has a blast radius of half a kilometre (a third of a mile). Gliding bombs are generally cheaper and easier to produce than other highly accurate systems, such as missiles or drones. Ukraine prides itself on having contained Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, allowing grain ships to continue using a safe corridor along its coastline to the territorial waters of NATO members Romania and Bulgaria. The Reuters news agency reported on Thursday that Ukraine had suspended that corridor because of a threat from Russian warplanes. Ukraine’s reconstruction minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, denied there had been a suspension. The US ambassador to Kyiv, Bridget Brink, appeared to reinforce Ukraine’s denial, saying 53 ships had passed safely through the corridor in September, delivering 2 million tonnes of grain. Russia pulled out of a deal to allow Ukraine’s grain ships to cross the Black Sea in July after Ukraine attacked the Kerch Bridge to Crimea for a second time. Russia threatened to prevent ships from loading at Ukrainian ports, but Ukraine has since managed to keep the Russian fleet at bay.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

North Korea is supplying munitions to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine in return for satellite technology, South Korea has said. Pyongyang has supplied Moscow with more than one million artillery shells since early August, Seoul’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) reported on Wednesday. In return, Russia is assumed to be providing technology and know-how to North Korea, which is making a third effort to launch a satellite following two failures. South Korean lawmaker Yoo Sang-bum said that Pyongyang has sent around 10 arms shipments to Russia\\xa0by air, as well as via naval shipments between a North Korean east coast port and Russian ports, as the United States has previously claimed. More than one million artillery shells were transported by sea, originating from the port of Najin and reaching the Russian ports of Dunai and Vostochny, according to NIS. From there, they were conveyed by train to Ukraine, near the Toretsk ammunition depot. It is estimated that these deliveries will keep Russian forces in Ukraine supplied for two months. Meanwhile, the West is struggling to keep pace in supplying Ukraine’s forces with ammunition. “North Korea is running its munition factories to full capacity to meet demand for military supplies to Russia and even mobilising residents and civilian factories to make ammunition boxes for exports,” Yoo said. The US, South Korea, and Japan have condemned North Korea’s supply of arms and military equipment to Russia, and Moscow’s supply of technology in the other direction. The allegations have been denied by both North Korea and the Kremlin. “Russia, as a responsible member of the world community, strictly adheres to its international obligations towards Pyongyang through the UN Security Council,” Russian Ambassador at Large Oleg Burmistrov said in response to the allegations. North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in September in eastern Russia, where the leaders toured Russia’s most important satellite launch centre, the Vostochny Cosmodrome. During the meeting, President Putin said Russia would help North Korea build satellites, without providing specifics. Observers speculated after the meeting that Moscow would help with North Korea’s space programme in return for supplying conventional weapons. Indeed, North Korea appears to have received technical assistance from Russia with its spy satellite system, South Korea’s spy agency claims. North Korea lacks both financial resources and technical expertise in its satellite programme, and appears to have not yet mastered the technology for atmospheric re-entry of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) warheads, Yoo said. Now, Pyongyang is in the final stages of a third, likely successful, satellite launch attempt, after two previous failed attempts. North Korea also hopes to receive Russian fighter jets and other aircraft in the exchange, according to Yoo.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Ukraine’s strategy to quell Russia’s control of Crimea and the Black Sea requires patience, says Zelenskyy. Russian officials have declared an air raid alert in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol in anticipation of further attacks from Ukraine. Sirens went off in the city early on Wednesday. Traffic on the Crimean bridge, linking the peninsula to Russia, as well as sea transport, were suspended. The alert comes amid a string of Ukrainian attacks in recent weeks in and around Crimea, which was seized and annexed by Moscow in 2014. Kyiv’s forces have struck a Russian air base on the peninsula and the Black Sea Fleet command post in Sevastopol, as Ukraine seeks to weaken Russia’s control over the water. Moscow on Tuesday accused Ukraine of\\xa0the\\xa0attempted assassination of pro-Russian politician Oleg Tsaryov in Yalta. The Crimean Bridge was attacked in July.\\xa0 At the same time, amid disappointing results from Kyiv’s much-vaunted counteroffensive, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is seeking to rouse his country ahead of a winter campaign anticipated to be harsh. Ukraine hopes that weakening Russian forces on the Black Sea will deliver an ultimate victory in the war. The “illusion” of Russia’s domination of Crimea and the Black Sea had been shattered, Zelenskyy told a meeting of the Crimea Platform on October 24. “The Russian (Black Sea) fleet is no longer able to operate in the western part of the Black Sea and is gradually fleeing from Crimea,” Zelenskyy said. “And this is a historic achievement.” The attacks have highlighted Kyiv’s growing capabilities, which include naval drones. Meanwhile, Moscow continues bombarding Ukraine from afar with long-range missiles and assault drones. Last week, the Russian defence ministry said “a set of mine and anti-sabotage measures” in Sevastopol Bay had intercepted three unmanned Ukrainian boats. Ukraine said on Wednesday that Russia had shelled more than 100 settlements over the last 24 hours; the highest number of attacks on any single day so far in 2023. “We have not yet gained full fire control over Crimea and surrounding waters, but we will,” Zelenskyy told the attendees of the diplomatic initiative gathered in Prague. “This is a question of time.” On Monday, the Ukrainian military claimed a successful attack on a Crimean Russian air defence base with naval drones and missiles. As the strategy persists, and a downbeat analysis of Ukraine’s progress with its counteroffensive mounts, Zelenskyy sought on Tuesday to rouse his troops and country with a message of patience, perseverance and focus on the final goal. “We live in a world that gets used to success too quickly. When the full-scale invasion began, many people around the world did not believe that Ukraine would survive,” the Ukrainian president said in his nightly video address on Tuesday. “Glory to all those who do not retreat, who do not burn out, who believe in Ukraine just as they did on February 24, and who has been fighting for unwaveringly.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Moscow appears to be flouting its own laws to boost its forces, targeting foreign workers from Central Asia. Kyiv, Ukraine – In mid-October, Mamut Useinov performed on Sing Better Than a Star, a popular Russian television show for aspiring singers on the state-controlled Channel One network. “I’ve been anticipating this and can’t hide my excitement,” the 25-year-old from annexed Crimea wrote on Telegram on October 15, as he thanked “the Almighty” for the chance. But Useinov’s way to stardom was cut short. Five days after the broadcast, Useinov went to a “prayer house”, a type of informal mosque that offers a place to worship in the absence of officially sanctioned places for prayer. Heavily armed riot police officers detained him along with several dozen men who gathered for the Muslim Friday prayer in Kotelniki, an overpopulated southeastern suburb of Moscow where labour migrants settle because rent is cheap. All the men were forced into a police bus for an ID check and taken to a military conscription office in the nearby town of Lybertsy, according to Useinov and media reports. There, they underwent a medical evaluation that deemed Useinov “fit for military service”, despite flat feet and a recent surgery, he said. They were reportedly shipped to a military base east of Moscow and given a choice – go to jail or enlist. “We were all told that we have to sign one-year contracts, otherwise – jail,” he said in a Telegram-posted video on October 21, without specifying the charges they may face. He fears that once they sign the contract, the men will be sent to the front lines in Ukraine, the nation where Useinov was born and whose national he was, before accepting Russian citizenship in 2014, he wrote. “During a morning lineup, I heard we would all be send to the special military operation,” he wrote using the Kremlin’s preferred euphemism for the war in Ukraine. In a video he posted, he is seen in a small room filled with men next to bunkbeds listening to an elderly ethnic Russian man in camouflage. One more video shows the courtyard of a large building whose sand-coloured brick walls are adorned with a Russian flag and a banner reading, “Devotion to the motherland.” He went incommunicado on October 22. At the time of publishing, Useinov had not responded to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment. He has been taken to yet another military base for basic training, his representative told the Astra telegram channel on October 23. What Useinov described blatantly violated Russian rights legislation. The men were detained and denied access to lawyers. They were told about being conscripted without receiving a written notification issued by the conscription office where each man is registered – and then signed by the recipient. The men had no chance to overrule the forced conscription in court – or voice their objection to military service. Conscientious objectors have a right to an alternative service in Russia. “This procedure violated all of my rights,” Useinov wrote.      Dire demographic problems and oil wealth turned Russia into a magnet for millions of labour migrants from ex-Soviet Central Asia. Some Crimean Tatars, a Muslim community of about 200,000 in the annexed peninsula, became part of this influx as they share ties with Turkic-speaking nations of Central Asia, a region their forefathers had been deported to en masse in 1944. Meanwhile, Russia’s mostly Muslim, impoverished and corruption-choked North Caucasus is one of the few regions with high birth rates, and hundreds of thousands also move to Moscow and other big cities. But attending a mosque almost anywhere in Russia can be complicated and sometimes dangerous. Moscow only has five official mosques, and tens of thousands of believers throng areas around them during Muslim holidays, putting their prayer mats on the asphalt or even tram tracks. Most labour migrants choose to attend informal “prayer houses”, which some locals and police see as hotbeds of “extremism”. These houses have mushroomed because authorities routinely do not sanction new mosques, even though Muslims are Russia’s fastest-growing population stratum. While the Kremlin tries to revive its Soviet-era clout in the Middle East, courting Muslim leaders and calling Islam one of Russia’s “traditional religions”, Russian police snub religious rules and rights during their raids on prayer houses. They do not take their boots off, interrupt prayers, shower believers with slurs, and spray them with tear gas, according to dozens of reports, photos and videos. Far-right role Russian far-right nationalists help organise raids on “prayer houses”, in an apparent effort to kill two birds with one stone. They see the forcible conscription of Muslims as a way to rid Russia of unwanted “aliens” and help the faltering war effort, according to analysts. Zov (Call), a group whose closed Telegram channel has 141,000 subscribers, routinely informs police about Muslim gatherings – and proudly announces raids, detentions and deportations. “Just now, police visited two illegal mosques organised in apartment buildings. More than 70 people were rounded up. Awaiting deportation,” one of Zov’s posts said. The group is led by Andrey Tkachuk, head of a small media group in Moscow, and Andrey Afanasyev, a former staffer of the Tsargrad television channel whose oligarch owner Konstantin Malofeyev has been sanctioned in the West as a sponsor of separatists in Ukraine’s Donbas region. Muslim labour migrants have faced hate attacks, arbitrary detentions and arrests, police brutality, extortion and threats for decades. But after the Kremlin realised that its blitzkrieg in Ukraine failed amid disastrous losses of manpower, it threw a new curveball their way. As part of a nationwide series of raids dubbed “Illegal 2023”, police have been combing construction sites, markets, farms, restaurants, apartment buildings, hostels and “prayer houses” – or simply rounding up anyone who does not look Slavic, according to rights groups and media reports. During ID checks, they find “problems” – both imaginary and real, such as a lack of registration, a blurred stamp, or an expired work permit. The migrants are locked up and forced to enlist in military service, facing several kinds of threats to ensure their cooperation, an expert said. Shukhrat Ganiyev, a human rights advocate based in the central Uzbek city of Bukhara, told Al Jazeera that the pressure put on migrants included “threat of deportation of [their] families from Russia, the planting of drugs, an intolerable atmosphere for business”. He said some Uzbeks had signed contracts for construction jobs in the Russia-occupied southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, but then ended up on the front line – “and were not heard of since”. Police in St Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city and President Vladimir Putin’s hometown, said they handed conscription papers to 56 migrants with Russian passports after just one raid on a market on September 6. A month earlier, about 100 migrants were served with conscription papers, it said. The Illegal 2023 investigations are “tied to organisation of illegal migration, trade in drugs and psychotropic substances, arms trade and border crossings”, Ministry of Internal Affairs spokeswoman Irina Vovk said. Another way of forcing Muslim migrants into the trenches has been to deny Central Asians citizenship – a red Russian passport eliminates many of the problems with police and bureaucratic hurdles that migrants face. In one case, migration officials turned down an application from a Tajik man whose mother is a Russian national, according to rights advocate Tatyana Kotlyar. The man was told to enlist first, even though as a father of five he cannot be drafted, she said. In another case, an Uzbek man whose wife and child are Russian nationals, was told that “without a [military] contract and participation in the special military operation, they won’t even accept his citizenship application,” Kotlyar, who is based in the city of Obninsk 120km (75 miles) southwest of Moscow, told Al Jazeera. Both men did not reply to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. And in Kaluga, a region of more than one million people, some 200km (124 miles) south of Moscow, foreign workers have been barred from submitting citizenship applications in recent months unless they enlist, Kotlyar said. Officials at the Kaluga migration office refused to comment on her claim. And even if a migrant already has a Russian passport, recently adopted laws allow authorities to take it away with ease. “If you are a Russian national but are not ready to fulfil your military duty, a decision should be made to strip such a man of his citizenship,” Russia’s top investigator Aleksander Bastrykin told a military conference in mid-October. Bastrykin said earlier that migrants have a “constitutional duty to defend the nation that accepted them” and that enlisting them should be a “priority”. There have even been calls to abolish age limits for migrants so that they can be forced to serve in the military. The conscription age in Russia is between 18 and 30. “You became a Russian national at age 50 – go serve at 50,” nationalist lawmaker Aleksey Zhuravlyev said on October 24. Muslim migrants are among the most vulnerable people in Russia, said Sergey Abashin, a migration expert and anthropologist based in St Petersburg. They are often subject to the whims of police officers and officials because they “always” have problems with their documents, he said. “The [Russian] legislation’s very design makes it impossible to have absolutely ‘clean’ documents,” he said. The migrants are also dependent on the goodwill of their employers, as many work without the permits to do so. Meanwhile, public opinion is dominated by rampant nationalism, xenophobia and often portrays Muslim newcomers as hostile and alien, he said. “The sum of these dependencies makes migrants easily victimised,” he said. Very few make their cases public, fearing persecution of their families, rights advocates have said, adding the immigrants are accustomed to authoritarian rule and police brutality in their countries of origin, often know little about their civil rights in Russia, do not have access to lawyers, and may not speak much Russian. Where there is a stick, there follows a carrot – promises of hefty pay and a Russian passport. “Since at least May 2023, Russia has approached Central Asian migrants to fight in Ukraine with promises of fast-track citizenship and salaries of up to $4,160,” the British Defence Ministry said in September. In September 2022, Putin signed a decree that gives Russian nationality to anyone who has served on the front line for six months. The first Uzbek national taken prisoner in Ukraine said he was driven by financial interest, according to a Ukrainian media report. Lying on his back in a camouflaged coat, Mukhriddin Akhmedov, a 22-year-old student from the central Uzbek city of Samarkand, said he joined the Redoubt military company because he “needed money”. He said that “one more Uzbek” had joined the company. Looking ahead, the Russian military faces a shortage of manpower on the front lines after heavy casualties in the so-called “meat storms” on Ukrainian positions, experts have said. The shortage is exacerbated by Russia’s catastrophically low birthrates and a population loss of hundreds of thousands of people a year in the rapidly aging nation of 143 million. “By waging the war in Ukraine via the tactics of ‘meat storms’ and thus suffering heavy losses of manpower, the Russian military began experiencing a lack of cannon fodder,” Alisher Ilkhamov, head of the London-based Central Asia Due Diligence group, told Al Jazeera. Although their forcible conscription has undermined earlier official steps to limit Central Asia natives’ access to firearms – for years, Central Asian migrants were denied permits to buy hunting rifles – the political risk to Russian leaders is minimal. So far, there has only been a single public incident associated with the forced conscription of migrants. Last October, two Tajik nationals were forcibly sent to a training camp before departure to Ukraine. After the men, Ekhson Aminzoda and Mekhrob Rakhmonov, heard their commanding officers “insult their religion”, they got hold of a machine gun and killed 11 people and injured 15 others. The two were shot dead and pronounced “terrorists” by authorities. Meanwhile, the Kremlin is afraid to declare a second round of mobilisation in advance of the March 2024 presidential election, he said. The September 2022 “partial” mobilisation triggered an exodus of hundreds of thousands of Russian men, making migrants more attractive targets. “In such conditions, the emphasis is on recruiting migrants, as their loss on the front line will not affect Russia politically or economically,” Ilkhamov said.

Russia has accused the Ukrainian government of carrying out the attempted assassination of former Ukrainian Member of Parliament and Moscow-backed separatist Oleg Tsaryov. The Russian state news agency TASS reported on Tuesday that the FSB, Russia’s federal security agency, had arrested a 46-year-old Russian man who resides in Crimea for allegedly acting as an accomplice. The FSB said that the suspect confessed to his role in helping coordinate the plot by conducting surveillance and leaving a cache of weapons, saying that he acted “on the instructions of Ukraine’s security service”. The pro-Russian politician and businessman Tsaryov was shot twice in his home in Yalta, Crimea, last week. The FSB has said that he is in “satisfactory” condition. Media reports had identified Tsaryov as the potential leader of a prospective puppet government in Kyiv that Russia had hoped to install when it launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. That plan was denied by Tsaryov, who told the news outlet Reuters, which reported on the prospective plan, that the account had “very little to do with reality”.      Ukrainian media outlets and the news service Reuters reported last week that the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) was responsible for the assassination effort on Tsaryov, who a Ukrainian source told Reuters was an “absolutely legal” target. The 53-year-old, who owns a hotel in Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, was a former member of Ukraine’s parliament. When Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine began fighting Ukrainian forces in 2014, Tsaryov became the leader of the separatist parliament known as Novorossiya. He has been sanctioned by Ukraine, the United States, and several other Western countries and is listed as a “traitor to the Motherland” by Ukraine.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Speaking at security forum in Beijing, defence minister warns of growing risk of confrontation between nuclear-armed countries. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has accused the United States of fuelling geopolitical tensions to uphold its “global dominance by any means” and warned of the growing risk of confrontation between nuclear-armed countries. Addressing the Xiangshan Forum, China’s biggest military diplomacy conference, Shoigu also claimed the NATO alliance was trying to expand its footprint in the Asia Pacific under the pretence of seeking dialogue and collaboration with regional countries. “Washington for years has deliberately undermined and destroyed the foundations of international security and strategic stability, including the system of arms control agreements,” Shoigu said at the start of the three-day event on Monday. “Having provoked an acute crisis in Europe, the West is trying to expand the crisis potential in the Asia Pacific,” he told delegates from about 90 countries. “Direct involvement of countries with nuclear arsenals multiplies the strategic risks. The West’s line towards escalation with Russia poses a risk of direct conflict between nuclear powers, which will result in catastrophic consequences,” Shoigu added. Shoigu’s gloomy assessment was echoed by China, whose defence minister Li Shangfu was sacked without explanation last week after disappearing from public view at the end of August. China has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has deepened economic, diplomatic and military cooperation with Moscow since the start of the war in February 2022. Russian President Vladimir Putin this month paid a two-day visit to China, his first outside the former Soviet Union this year and part of the Kremlin’s drive to strengthen its economic partnerships across Asia. Zhang Youxia, China’s second most senior military official, painted a grim picture of the international situation, blaming countries he did not name for the turmoil. “As we look across the world today, hotspot issues are arising one after another. The pain of war, chaos and turmoil, and loss of life are constantly playing out,” Zhang said. “Some countries, for fear that the world may stabilise, deliberately create turmoil, interfere in regional issues, interfere in other countries’ internal affairs, and instigate colour revolutions,” he said. “Behind the scenes, they hand out knives and think nothing of provoking people into wars, ensuring that they’re the ones who benefit from the chaos,” he added. Zhang – who embraced Shoigu on the sidelines of the forum – said that Beijing was “willing to develop military ties with the US on the basis of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.” China suspended military communication with the US, which was represented at the forum by a delegation led by Xanthi Carras, the leading official on China at the Pentagon, in August 2022. In recent years, the US has deepened its relationships with countries across the Asia Pacific, with initiatives such as the Quad that includes Australia, India and Japan, as well as the AUKUS project with Australia and the United Kingdom, which involves the sharing of nuclear-powered submarine technology and the development of advanced weaponry. The US has also furthered security cooperation with Japan and South Korea, as well as with the Philippines, where it has secured access to military bases.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'The ‘friendly’ countries include China, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Kazakhstan and Belarus. Russia will ease investment processes for citizens and companies from “friendly” countries, as it seeks to establish an anti-Western coalition and shore up its sanctions-hit economy. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced on Monday that investment processes will be simplified for investors from 25 countries considered allies by Moscow. In the wake of its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and subsequent efforts by Western states to isolate it and trim its economic power to wage war, Russia has been seeking to strengthen ties around the globe. The “friendly” countries whose citizens and companies will be able to open Russian bank accounts and make deposits through a simplified process include China, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Kazakhstan and Belarus. “Creating more convenient conditions for foreign enterprises and entrepreneurs is an important part of the government’s systemic efforts to achieve financial sovereignty as part of the implementation of the national goals set by our president,” Mishustin said in a statement. According to Moscow, “unfriendly” nations are those that have joined a slew of Western-led economic sanctions in response to its war in Ukraine. Russia has likened the sanctions to “a declaration of war”. On Monday, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu singled out one of the primary instigators of the sanctions, the United States, at a defence conference in Beijing, accusing it of disrupting global security and harming Russia’s interests. “To maintain its geopolitical and strategic dominance, the United States is deliberately undermining the basis of international security and strategic stability,” Shoigu said. Shoigu also pointed the finger at the US’s Western and Asia Pacific allies, without naming them. “Western countries aim to escalate the conflict with Russia and increase the risk of major country confrontation … This will lead to serious consequences,” he added. US-Russia relations have deteriorated since Moscow launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine, resulting in a bloody 20-month war. The US has supplied some $75bn in humanitarian, financial and military aid to Ukraine as it fends off Russian forces. A group of Western nations and blocs, including the US, the European Union, and the United Kingdom have imposed far-reaching sanctions on Moscow.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'From a subterranean town to a brigade on the southern front, an inside look at life on four front lines over four days. Al Jazeera’s Alex Gatopoulos travelled to four front-line locations in October. This is the last of a mini-series of dispatches from that trip. Read his previous dispatches about life in a subterranean front-line town, the village that lost one-sixth of its population after a Russian air strike and a brigade on the southern front. At 2:45am, we head to the rendezvous point where Stepan, our military liaison officer, will meet us. We will be taken to a mortar position before heading to the start line of an assault, a couple of kilometres away. The checkpoints are more suspicious of us as we are the only ones travelling in the dark. We are pulled over by the police and the driver, Denis, and the fixer, Dimi, are questioned. Our embed is with the military and in general the two organisations don’t get on. Much discussion, checking of papers and phone calls ensue. The police are angry they weren’t informed and make us wait, saying the army has no authority here. Finally cleared to pass, we arrive at the rendezvous location, don our body armour and tramp off in the dark. Luke, our security consultant, tells us to stay in a straight line – no deviation due to mines. The path has been marked by shreds of white plastic tied to trees. Once at the mortar position, we will remain there for 20 minutes before moving again. Maybe. Things have a habit of changing quickly. I could really do with a coffee. Al Jazeera correspondent Zein watches videos of his little girl while we wait to move forward. We are all quiet. We drive in the dark for a while, pale predawn light on the horizon. This is the road that leads directly to Robotyne, only recently back in Ukrainian hands. The bark of artillery is more insistent now, accompanied by heavy mortars. It starts to get light. The distant booming echoes of the artillery sound like giants slamming doors – the vast scale of it doesn’t feel human. A quick interview with the commander is punctuated by nearby blasts and warnings that Russian jets are dropping KAB 250 and 500s, precision-guided bombs. We’ve filmed enough, no need to stay any longer. We head back. The car speeds up to avoid the attention of Russian spotter drones. We pull back to Orikhiv where we were a few days ago. Driving back through the wrecked town, we pass armoured personnel carriers crammed with soldiers on the roof. More military vehicles are gathered under trees, hiding from the spotters. The sky grows grey and it starts to rain. Orikhiv now behind us, we start to slow down. The houses are intact, normal programming has resumed and off comes the body armour. Our clothes, soaked with sweat, suddenly feel cold. We think about breakfast and coffee. It starts to rain heavily. We pull over and chat but receive a call with an offer to meet some of the medics who have been pulling shifts at the local first aid station. The body armour goes back on with minor grumbling. We climb into yet another vehicle. At the aid station, we speak to medics – all are exhausted, some are asleep in their bunks, others offer us chairs in the cramped bunker. Our selfish thoughts of food are forgotten as they share what they’ve seen, what they’ve witnessed, what they could and could not do, who they could and could not save.

       "  'Date': '29 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Taiwan considers its ability to counter a Chinese invasion attempt with lessons learned from Israel-Gaza war and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Taichung, Taiwan – On October 7, the Palestinian armed group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, firing thousands of rockets that quickly overwhelmed Israel’s state-of-the-art Iron Dome air defence system while thousands of fighters infiltrated southern Israel by air, sea and land. The significance of Hamas’s surprise attack was not lost on Taiwan’s military, which lives with a promise by Beijing’s political leaders to unify self-ruled Taiwan with China, by force if necessary. In the week after Hamas’s raid on Israel, the Taiwanese defence ministry announced the establishment of a task force to draw lessons from the Israel-Gaza war. Taiwan’s defence minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng, has said that an initial lesson is that intelligence gathering will be key to counter China’s threats. Taiwan also has the sea, said 42-year-old Tony Wei, who is a member of the Taiwanese reserves and a dentist by profession. Taiwan is separated from China’s east coast by a 130-kilometre (81-mile) stretch of ocean known as the Taiwan Strait which acts as a natural barrier and early warning system should Beijing try to overwhelm Taiwan in a surprise attack. “To invade Taiwan, they (the Chinese military) have to gather a very large fleet,” Wei told Al Jazeera. China’s mobilisation of such a naval force would probably be detected by Taiwan, giving the self-ruled island time to ready for an invasion or even launch a preemptive attack, Wei said. Still, the Hamas raid – largely considered unimaginable by military analysts before it happened – has made Wei question whether Taiwan truly possesses the capabilities necessary to counter a potentially determined Chinese military. “The Israelis have a very powerful military, an effective intelligence service and a lot of American support,” Wei said.\\xa0“If even Israel can be surprised and overwhelmed, then what about Taiwan?” The Israel-Gaza war is the second time the world has recently been taken aback by a military operation considered improbable until it was carried out. “They said that President Putin wouldn’t attack Ukraine, but he did, and they said that Hamas couldn’t attack Israel, but they did,” Wei said, referring to the Russian invasion of February 2022. “Taiwan needs to learn from these attacks in case our island becomes the next place where the unthinkable happens.” “Hamas’s attack achieved strategic, operational, and tactical surprise against the Israelis,” Eric Chan, a non-resident research fellow at the Global Taiwan Institute, told Al Jazeera. “Taiwan has a vested interest in avoiding this type of surprise, especially because their adversary has greater powers than Hamas,” Chan said. “The Russian invasion, as well as the surprise attack by Hamas, was an object demonstration that while you may think that the adversary is deterred by high costs, the adversary may actually not care,” he added. Fang-Yu Chen, an assistant professor at Soochow University in Taipei who researches political relations between Taiwan, China and the US, said that Taiwan’s announced establishment of a task force in the aftermath of the Hamas attack was an attempt to learn lessons in order to prevent a Taiwanese intelligence failure with regards to China. “Taiwan is constantly picking up a lot of information about China’s activities, but such information has to be verified, analysed and passed on to the right people,” Chen told Al Jazeera. According to Chen, Taiwan might look to strengthening its intelligence gathering in order to ensure that credible threats from China are clearly identified before a potential disaster strikes. “The next major consideration is what to do after an attack has already taken place,” he said. Taiwan’s government has taken steps in that direction, too.      More money is being allocated to the military; compulsory military service for Taiwanese citizens is being extended from four months to one year; the purchase of new missile systems was announced, and the island’s first domestically built submarine was also unveiled earlier this month. In its preparations, Taiwan has also looked to and learned from the war in Ukraine, according to Chen. A major lesson of Russia’s invasion is the importance of not only strengthening the island’s conventional military and intelligence but also its capabilities within the field of information warfare in order to win the battle of the narrative, he said. Chen has observed that China’s information operations directed at Taiwan have adjusted since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Before the Ukraine war, the propaganda was often about how the US will abandon Taiwan, but after the war, it has been about how the US is pushing China towards war,” he said. At the same time, Chen has detected a polarisation of public opinion in Taiwan with people who were already willing to fight against Chinese aggression becoming more willing to confront Beijing while those who were unwilling to fight have become even less willing. Amid this battle for public opinion and efforts to influence personal resolve among the Taiwanese, Taiwan’s government last year launched a ministry of digital affairs which has since introduced a range of measures to combat disinformation directed at the island and its population. In the battle of narratives it is not just a matter of countering disinformation that reaches Taiwan, said Wei, the military reservist, but also about how Taiwan obtains the backing of other countries. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen has also taken certain preliminary steps to accomplish this by encouraging the island to tell its own story to the world. Through the “Give Taiwan a Voice” campaign, her administration has protested against Taiwan’s exclusion from the United Nations and sought to highlight the island’s contributions to the international community. At the same time, Tsai has sought to reach out to and integrate Taiwan more extensively with countries in South and Southeast Asia through a so-called “southbound policy” under the slogan of “Taiwan helps Asia, Asia helps Taiwan”. Wei believes such initiatives are important if Taiwan is to win over world opinion in the face of increasing pressure from China. For Wei, the importance of winning the narrative was highlighted in the information battle that broke out between Israel and Hamas over responsibility for the deadly explosion at the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza. The fight to convince the world of the magnitude and responsibility for the hospital atrocity had far-reaching consequences as meetings between US President Joe Biden – Israel’s staunchest ally – and several Arab leaders were cancelled amid a global outcry over the attack. As Wei said, no one supports someone who bombs hospitals, and no one can win a war without assistance from the outside. Winning the information war, he said, will be crucial for Taiwan in any potential confrontation with China. “So, we must win the war of words so that we can count on international support if Chinese bombs strike Taiwan.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Russia is running short of shells but Israel’s war in Gaza threatens to cloud US diplomacy. Israel’s war against Hamas has deepened the international faultlines set during Russia’s war in Ukraine, as both sides seek to entrench an increasingly polarised pattern of global allegiances during the 87th week of the Ukraine war. US President Joe Biden tarred Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Hamas, which the United States and the European Union consider a terrorist group, with the same brush after visiting Israel on October 18. “Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: They both want to completely annihilate a neighbouring democracy,” Biden said in a primetime Oval Office speech watched by 20 million people. Washington’s European allies, who have stood behind Ukraine, also paid visits to Israel in a show of solidarity that simultaneously cemented their geopolitical allegiance. Biden further joined the Ukrainian and Israeli causes in Congress last week by seeking $105bn in new funding for them in a single bill, calling it “a smart investment that’s going to pay dividends for American security for generations”. “They used to call it ‘fighting for freedom and democracy’,” Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova lashed back in a message on the Telegram platform. “Now it turns out it is just calculations.” China and Russia, too, have sought to close ranks, saying they will focus on a “close coordination of efforts” to solve crises in the Middle East. Russia’s deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov met Zhai Jun, China’s special envoy for the Middle East, in Doha on the same day as Biden’s speech – October 20. Russia has also been tightening relations with Iran. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov visited Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Tehran on October 24 to “further build” their “multifaceted” partnership, Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. While supporting Hezbollah in Lebanon, a sworn enemy of Israel, Iran is also a supplier of Shahed kamikaze drones to Russia in its war in Ukraine. Russia now produces its own Shahed drones and, according to Russian news sources, it may have begun on October 23 to deploy a new type of Iranian drone, the Italmas, which is said to have a longer range and is harder to detect. Diplomacy, military technology and money are intimately connected. Ukraine has relied heavily on Western aid. The US spent nearly $77bn to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion between February 24 last year and July 31 this year, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank, and Biden wants Congress to agree to $60bn more. The EU has spent 82 billion euros ($86.7bn) since the beginning of the war. Some of this has come in the form of advanced military hardware, which has given Ukraine an edge. This month, Ukraine started using Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) from the US arsenal. Putin dismissed it as a weapon that “only prolongs the agony”, but Ukraine used it to damage at least five Russian helicopters at the Luhansk city airfield and cause further damage at an airfield in occupied Berdyansk. Putin is also in increasing financial difficulty. On Monday, Britain’s military intelligence said he had raised next year’s defence spending by 68 percent, bringing it to $82bn or 6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), possibly to cover increased medical and retirement costs for soldiers. Last week, Estonia’s military intelligence chief estimated Russia’s artillery ordnance at four million shells, which would allow it to continue a “low intensity” war for another year. Russia’s current firing rate of 10,000 to 15,000 shells a day contrasts with an average of 45,000 to 80,000 shells a day last year, intelligence chief Ants Kiviselg said. So far, the odd man out in the Western alliance has been Hungary whose prime minister, Viktor Orban, visited China this month to celebrate the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), during which he met Putin to reaffirm the bond between Russia and Hungary. Upon his return, Orban compared EU membership with Soviet occupation. Brussels’ model of liberal democracy does not fit Hungary, he said. “Fortunately, Brussels is not Moscow. Moscow was a tragedy. Brussels is just a bad contemporary parody,” Orban told guests in the city of Veszprem. Hungary was also the most reluctant EU member to give up imports of Russian oil last December. “The United States is concerned about Hungary’s relationship with Russia,” US ambassador to Hungary David Pressman said in a statement on October 20. Russia’s war in Ukraine has intensified in its 87th week, with Russian forces persisting in an assault on the eastern town of Avdiivka and Ukrainian forces scoring a few stealthy advances along the front. They were fighting to establish full control of the village two days later, according to the BBC’s Russian service. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said on October 20 that its troops had destroyed almost 50 Russian tanks and about 100 armoured fighting vehicles while repelling attacks near Avdiivka, on the eastern front. Some Ukrainian soldiers reported 200 Russian vehicles destroyed, losses which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy late last week described as “really staggering”. Russian forces have formed pincers to the north and south of the city, and have mounted a fierce offensive to overrun it in the past month. Ukraine’s southern forces spokesperson, Oleksandr Shtupun, said Russia was having to resupply the Avdiivka front with new soldiers directly from Russia, and by October 24, Reuters news agency reported the losses had forced Moscow to switch to air attacks. According to Gudmundsson, a tracker of Russian losses based on open sources, Russia’s single worst day of the war in terms of losses was October 20, with reported casualties of 1,380, compared with a daily 2023 average of just below 500. Geolocated footage on October 21 seemed to show that Russian forces had made marginal gains northwest of the city in a landfill area and had advanced again there two days later, but Ukraine’s military said another 20 lines of attack had failed. Some 45km to the north, Ukrainian forces were making slow progress in a pincer movement of their own around occupied Bakhmut on October 23, crossing a key railway line near Klishchiivka. Ukraine managed to establish a new bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnipro river in Kherson during this week, the 87th of Russia’s war, scaling up a new battle on what is already a 1,500km (932-mile) front. Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups gained a foothold in the village of Krynky, 2km from the Dnipro shoreline on October 19, a Russian military reporter said, confirmed by geolocated footage. Russia’s Defence Ministry said it had frustrated several attempts by reconnaissance groups to cross the Dnipro, without specifying where. Other Ukrainian units have already established footholds on parts of the shore and near the Antonivsky bridge, said the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington, DC-based think tank.

       "  'Text': 'From a subterranean town to the start of a pre-dawn assault, an inside look at life on four front lines over four days. Al Jazeera’s Alex Gatopoulos travelled to four front-line locations in October. Read his first dispatch about life in a subterranean front-line town and his second about a village that lost one-sixth of its population after a Russian air raid. Yesterday was a long day. The team tries to remain upbeat but everyone is a little ground down. We head out to meet the commander of a mechanised brigade on the southern front near the village of Robotyne. A combined arms formation, the brigade is made up of artillery and armoured units, combat engineers, reconnaissance and mobile infantry. The brigade is self-contained and designed to quickly exploit gaps and take advantage of any progress Ukraine may have made in the fighting, without having to wait for other specialised units. Because of this, they are always at the sharp end of the fighting. Dimi quietly sings to his young boy on the phone while we all loudly discuss what is happening in Israel and Gaza. As we follow an escort car to the rendezvous point, two fighter jets on combat patrol fly overhead, low and fast. The white arcs of smoke from rocket launches hang in the still morning air. The checkpoints become more muscular the closer we get – the soldiers manning them are heavily armed and focused – although we breeze through with the escort. We are taken to meet the brigade commander who will brief us on what we are allowed to film. After a brief chat, we are told we can return tomorrow to witness the preparations for a pre-dawn assault. Today, Stepan, sharp-eyed with a black wispy beard, will be our guide and take us to interview a T-72 tank commander. Much talk has been made of Western tank donations but it’s the Soviet-legacy T-72s and T-80s that provide the backbone of Ukraine’s armoured units. We pile into a convoy of military vehicles. There is a lot of military traffic on the road as cars and vans ferry troops in both directions. A green military ambulance wails past, heading to the aid station. We walk through a cornfield, a brisk wind rustling the dry beige leaves. A small sign tells us to beware of mines. A soldier pulls back a camouflage net to reveal two T-72 tanks. One of the tanks was captured from Russian forces and refurbished, the other was donated by the Czech Republic. A small black cat prowls beneath the tankers’ feet. The cat is clearly loved by the crew who have adopted it as their mascot. The tank commander chuckles as the cat bites his hand. When I ask about its name, they all shrug at the question. Climbing briefly into the gunner’s position on the turret, I’m immediately confronted by just how tight a squeeze it is. The space is cramped and crammed full. The main gun is to one side with the aiming sights and other equipment visible through padded eye-pieces facing forward. The thought of the tank catching fire and having to wrench open the heavy steel hatch to wriggle out and jump to safety seems like a long shot. For the most part, you fight or die in these things. The driver pops his head out the front hatch as the tank engine starts up. Everyone gets out of the way. Just before it starts to move, he beeps its horn as a warning, a strangely ineffectual sound, like something from a scooter. Under guidance from a soldier in front, the tank roars out from under the camouflage netting, turning and lurching as it growls out of sight, leaving a thick pall of engine smoke in its wake. Alasdair races off to catch it driving around the corner. He then pelts back just in time to film it returning. Its size, noise and speed catch us off-guard – who would have thought something that big could be that fast? A group photo, handshakes, goodbyes and we are off, this time to a front-line trench system, albeit in a quiet sector. Getting there is a 20-minute ride on the back of a pick-up truck bouncing over potholes, the tires whipping up dust as we are thrown around while nestled between supplies. A grinding stop. We jump off the back and into the trench system we go. The dirt floor is tidy, but the surrounding area is littered with used paper plates, plastic bottles, boxes, sacks and netting. The soldiers are dug in on a treeline, the open ground of southern Ukraine being virtual suicide to cross. In the first bunker, food is being prepared, the assigned cook methodically stirring something steaming in a pot. To our eyes, it’s almost pitch dark. Several bangs ring out, one after another, as an artillery battery steadily fires a salvo of shells at the Russian positions. Booms from other directions occasionally join in. The only other sounds are the wind moving through the trees and quiet conversations between the soldiers. We share the bumpy ride back with some soldiers and chat in broken English. “What music do we like?” they ask us. As children, they listened to Metallica and AC/DC. “AC/DC,” Zein and I both coo in reply. Some things are international. Stepan takes us to a house where we are offered coffee and biscuits, then given a talk in Ukrainian about mines. The engineer giving the lecture shows us various kinds of mines – anti-personnel, anti-vehicle and two types of Claymore mines. More coffee and biscuits. One of the soldiers receives a promotion. We all clap and the middle-aged man looks sheepish as he has his picture taken. We are driven to the next town to interview a local commander. Everything here is ruined – burned, smashed, littered with rubble. There are holes where there should be walls, burned cars lie rusting. Want to know what the Apocalypse will look like? Come here or any other war zone. Mini-apocalypses, local ends of the world, dotted around the planet, coming to a neighbourhood near you. And yet the humming of generators in the distance. There is still life here.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

Al Jazeera’s Alex Gatopoulos travelled to four front-line locations in October. This is the second of four dispatches – read his first\\xa0about subterranean life in a front-line town. It is still dark when we leave Zaporizhzhia. The pre-dawn air is cold and fresh. We compare how we slept – sleep is always at a premium on the road. We have a long way to travel today – a good 360km (224 miles) to a village in northeastern Ukraine called Hroza, which was devastated the day before by a Russian missile strike. More than 50 people – one-sixth of the population – were killed while attending a memorial service. Ukrainian officials said the town was hit by an Iskander missile, a precision-guided weapon with a 700kg (1,550lb) warhead. There were no obvious military targets nearby. On our way, we first stop in the city of Kharkiv, whose centre had been struck twice this morning. We rush to set up for a live shot near a 10-metre-wide (33ft-wide) crater in the centre of an intersection. The blast shredded the facades of nearby apartment blocks. Window frames and balconies hang in tatters. A mangled Toyota truck lies on its side as the blackened shell of a van is towed away. Unbelievably, considering the extensive damage, no one was killed. City engineers are already there, plans for utility pipes in their hands, checking for leaks. Volunteers methodically shovel rubble, their feet crunching on shards of glass and metal fragments. A team of telecommunication workers on ladders repair phone lines. The trunks of felled trees are neatly cut up and dumped on trucks as are clumps of tarmac. This is what passes for normal in Kharkiv. It is 11am. We head to the second blast site – a building that is all but destroyed. Clouds of dust from firefighters shovelling rubble from the upper floors obscure the ruin. The clean-up has been swifter there. Our IDs are checked twice by police. A stall serves coffee to red-eyed emergency workers. Piles of rubble are disposed of. Alasdair, the cameraman, runs ahead to get the best footage. The police collect and carefully place parts of the missile into the van to be taken to forensics. Down the road, a long, patient queue has formed behind a truck distributing boards to shore up broken windows and doors. Back on the road, we rush, wanting to get to Hroza to make our next live slot. As we near the village, we pass the cemetery on our left and see men digging new graves for people who were alive just yesterday. The blast site itself is shattered although the crater has already been filled in. The surrounding lawn has dark stains from blood that has soaked into the ground. Brown bandages, an abandoned tourniquet, blue, rubber forensic gloves, smashed phones, watches and purses lie in the grass and mud. I step away from the site for fear of treading on something sacred. It is hard to put into words – people suffered and died here, countless life-or-death dramas played out on the grass just yesterday. Dozens of people were killed here in an instant. The others died shortly after as medics fought to keep them alive. The dark stains hint at their tragic deaths. The playground nearby has been smashed like a giant’s hand has swept it aside. A single burned insole lies in the sand. Something that looks like a body is concealed under a weighed-down tarp, guarded by a policeman.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

Al Jazeera’s Alex Gatopoulos travelled to four front-line locations in October. This is the first of four dispatches. Our intrepid driver Denis is taking us to Huliaipole, a front-line town in southeastern Ukraine that has borne the brunt of recent fighting. Alongside me in the car are Al Jazeera correspondent Zein, cameraman Alasdair, our security consultant Luke and Dimi, our fixer extraordinaire, without whom we’d get very little done. A weary soldier manning a checkpoint pulls us over. The police are called, and a small car arrives to escort us the rest of the way to meet the town’s mayor. We pull up to a door set into the side of a ruined apartment block. This is the entrance to the town’s aid centre, less than 1km (0.6 miles) from the first Ukrainian trenches. Life for the people who have remained here has moved underground. We head down a long flight of dark stairs and turn into a long corridor to find water filtration plants and hot water boilers for a row of showers. Chairs have been placed inside some of the stalls for those who can’t stand. Farther along, a laundromat hums. There is even a salon where elderly ladies chat as they wait to get their hair done. Inside a makeshift cinema, a keyboard and speakers sit to one side. A wall is dotted with children’s drawings of forests, flowers and Ukrainian flags. Someone has put up balloons. A canteen at the back of the space serves coffee and biscuits. We interview the mayor, Sergiy Yarmark, who has helped set up this station and is proud of what has been achieved. People sleep in basements dotted all over Huliaipole but come here to wash, clean their clothes and preserve what little they have of their old lives. Zein asks him what day hurt him the most. He tears up as he speaks of his best friend, who was killed nearly a year ago. A friendly yet sombre place, everyone here has similar stories, similar heartache. Back on the street, only animal life is visible. Pigeons arc and wheel over the tops of gutted buildings, blackened by shelling. Below them, nothing remains of a burned-out shop that once sold children’s clothing but the sign. We shelter from the sun in the shadow of a building. Dogs bask in the grass under trees that have begun shedding leaves. The ever-present hum of generators – the only power source in the town – is the only sign that people still live here, tucked away in basements. Most of the shelling happens at night. A man, taking advantage of the daytime lull, nervously carries a plastic bag full of laundry to the aid centre and heads downstairs. The only other people outside crowd around the centre’s door. Policemen talk with villagers around a plastic tub full of old paper coffee cups. Every now and then, soldiers drive up for a chat with the canteen workers who have come up into the sunlight to smoke cigarettes. We cross the main boulevard on foot. There is only eerie silence. A single bomb has smashed a building in front of us, the blast so powerful it shattered the structure across the road and shredded a line of trees. By the rubble is a tourist sign, virtually intact. It reads: “I Love Huliaipole.” We are driven to an animal sanctuary where the windows are covered with United Nations-provided polythene sheeting. The building doubles as a clinic for local pets. We interview the owner of a dog who is being prepped to be neutered. Suddenly squeamish, I step outside. The smallest dog in the world trots past, blissfully unaware of what is happening to its compatriot. Again, the generator hum – life is here. The tempo of the outgoing artillery fire picks up from batteries nearby, and we decide to leave. An interview with the vet is wrapped up. An elderly woman emerges from the sanctuary to head back home on her bicycle. She opens up her shopping bag to show us the forlorn, neutered dog cowering inside.

       "  'Text': 'Shoigu visited the “Vostok” command post to be briefed on front-line developments and preparations for winter combat. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has visited a command post near the front lines in eastern Ukraine as fighting in the region intensifies in advance of the harsh winter season. He travelled to the “Vostok” command post in the east to be briefed on developments at the front as Russian forces stepped up attacks, according to footage posted by the Ministry of Defence\\xa0on Wednesday. The minister was briefed on preparations for combat for the forthcoming winter and the training of drone operators, the Ministry of Defence said, according to AFP. “The situation today suggests the enemy has fewer and fewer opportunities. And they will continue to be reduced, thanks exclusively to your combat work,” Shoigu told Russian soldiers as he sought to raise morale. The Ministry of Defence, whose video showed Shoigu arriving at the post via helicopter, added that the minister “drew special attention to the timely and sufficient provision of new winter uniforms and insulated footwear for all personnel” before winter, when temperatures plunge below freezing. Shoigou’s visit comes as Russia stepped up attacks in eastern Ukraine, hammering the city of Avdiivka with air and artillery attacks. Ukrainian officials claim that Moscow’s forces have suffered heavy bloodshed, losing thousands of troops in less than a week. “The enemy is persistently trying to surround the city and is throwing in new forces from the north and south,” Vitaliy Barabash, head of Avdiivka’s military administration, told Ukrainian television on Tuesday. “For two days, they have been operating mostly in small groups, trying to find cracks in our defence, but without success. The defence line is holding.” Further east in Crimea, Ukraine also claims to have been making inroads despite struggling to progress its counteroffensive.      Russia, meanwhile, has continued its assault on the southeastern Kherson region. The bombing killed one person early on Wednesday after four people were injured on Tuesday. Ukrainian authorities have recently ruled that families with children must evacuate the region. Sixteen people were injured in a Russian drone attack in the western Khmelnytskyi region late on Tuesday night, a local official said Critical infrastructure was damaged, a local official reported, without offering details. Khmelnytskyi\\xa0is home to a Ukrainian military airfield. “In Shepetivka district, as a result of the downing of enemy aerial targets, they crashed on the territory of a critical infrastructure facility,” a senior official in the Khmelnytskyi\\xa0region, Sehiy Tiurin, said on the Telegram messaging app. The Ukrainian military said its air forces had taken out all 11 Russian drones. It has been months since either Russia or Ukraine made a significant territorial gain in the 20-month conflict, as losses continue to mount. Analysts say the conflict is approaching a winter deadlock.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '25 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Law to revoke ratification of CTBT on its way to President Putin for signing after parliament vote Russian lawmakers have approved a bill revoking the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). The move adds to the tension between Moscow and the West amid Russia’s war in Ukraine. The upper house Federation Council unanimously approved the bill to abandon the landmark agreement outlawing nuclear weapons tests on Wednesday. The lower house State Duma passed it in an accelerated vote last week. The legislation now only needs the signature of President Vladimir Putin to come into effect. Moscow announced on October 6 its intention to withdraw from the treaty to “mirror” the position of the United States, which has itself signed but never ratified the treaty. It is unclear, however, whether the revocation will result in Russia resuming tests of nuclear weapons. Putin said on October 5: “I hear calls to start testing nuclear weapons. I am not ready to say whether we really need to conduct tests or not.” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said earlier this month that Moscow will continue to respect the ban and will only resume nuclear tests if the US does so. However, he noted on Wednesday that the US conducted a chemical explosion at its test site in Nevada. While Washington said the test would help it “detect” low-yield nuclear explosions, Ryabkov told the Federation Council that the blast was “undoubtedly a political signal”. “As our president said, we must be on alert, and if the United States moves towards the start of nuclear tests, we will have to respond here in the same way,” the official said. The US stated earlier this month that it was “disturbed” by Russia’s move to revoke ratification of the treaty. “A move like this by any state party needlessly endangers the global norm against nuclear explosive testing,” the US State Department said. Russia should not be “wielding arms control and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric in a failing attempt to coerce other states”, the State Department added, appearing to suggest that the move was aimed at pressuring the US and other countries who are supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian forces. Since invading the neighbouring country, Putin has repeatedly invoked Russia’s nuclear doctrine.      With the abandonment of the CTBT, the last remaining bilateral nuclear weapons treaty between Washington and Moscow is New START, under which the pair used to regularly inspect each other’s nuclear facilities and limit warheads. Russia suspended the treaty in February. It is due to expire in early 2026. On Wednesday, Ryabkov told journalists in Moscow that the Kremlin had received informal proposals from the US to resume talks on issues of strategic stability and arms control “in isolation from everything that is happening”. However, he said that\\xa0Moscow believes it is “simply impossible” to return to such dialogue without a change in the “deeply fundamental hostile course towards Russia on the part of the US”.

Russia’s economy has adapted well to Western sanctions and Moscow does not fear the prospect of more such measures, the Kremlin says. On February 25, 2022, a day after Russia undertook a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the European Union introduced wide-ranging sanctions intended to send a clear signal to Moscow that there would be severe consequences for the war. The bloc has imposed 11 sanctions packages to date and last week said it would work to shut down loopholes in the existing measures. EU officials have suggested the sanctions could remain in place for years. “Russia has been living under a sanctions regime for quite a long time, for decades, and we have sufficiently adapted to it, so such time horizons as five to 10 years do not scare us,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday.      Russia said sanctions have boosted its domestic economy and industrial production. Some observers argued that the sanctions have been circumvented and have failed to deter Russia in its war against Ukraine. According to a report by the Norway-based risk consultancy Corisk – which analysed customs data from 12 EU countries, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan – the circumvention of export sanctions on Russia amounted to about 8 billion euros ($8.5bn) in 2022.

       "  'Text': 'The Black Sea, which Ukraine needs to export its grain, has been a key battleground in the ongoing war. Russia’s Ministry of Defence says its naval forces have destroyed three unmanned Ukrainian boats in the northern part of the Black Sea off the Crimean Peninsula, the latest in a series of attacks around the contested waterway that is crucial to Russia’s offensive against Kyiv. “Anti-sabotage missiles and bombs hit the area where the unmanned boats were detected,” the ministry said on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday. It added that an anti-mining and an “anti-sabotage” operation was being conducted off the port of Sevastopol in the Black Sea, where Russia’s Black Sea Fleet is based. Moscow has used that fleet, comprised of some 30 warships, to try to blockade Ukraine’s coastline and fire missiles at Ukrainian cities. It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties from the latest Black Sea attack — and Kyiv issued no immediate comment. Ukraine has in recent months stepped up attacks on Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, helping it win back limited control of the Black Sea and, at times, push Russian warships further east.      In September, Kyiv claimed it had hit two naval vessels and struck Sevastopol’s port infrastructure, inflicting what appeared to be the most severe damage to that area in the war. “Ukraine’s actions have wrestled control of Ukraine’s western territorial waters back from Russia and prevented the Black Sea Fleet from threatening Odesa with amphibious assault or providing tactical fires and logistical support to Russian forces in Kherson,” retired US Army Major-General Gordon Skip Davis Jr told Al Jazeera in early October. Ukraine’s engagement in the Black Sea has helped it establish a new “humanitarian corridor” in the waterway to get out its exports after Moscow deserted a deal to guarantee Kyiv’s shipments in July. Since the opening of the corridor, which cuts through the waters of NATO members Bulgaria and Romania to deter Russia, Ukraine has exported some 700,000 tonnes of grain, helping it preserve a key component of its economy. “We see a trend towards an increase in the number of ships leaving our ports. We hope it will continue,” senior Ukrainian agricultural official Mykola Solsky said on Monday.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '24 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Visit takes place amid Israel-Hamas war and escalating tensions in the disputed South China Sea. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will travel to the United States later this week as part of an ongoing effort to repair the two countries’ strained ties amid growing geopolitical crises. Wang will visit Washington from October 26-28 and meet US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and President Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan, officials said, after Blinken and other top officials travelled to Beijing in June. The US is keen to ensure disagreements between Washington and Beijing do not veer into conflict and that they can work together on issues of mutual concern. Other US politicians have travelled to China since Blinken’s visit, with California Governor Gavin Newsom currently in the country to discuss climate change. “We continue to believe that direct face-to-face diplomacy is the best way to raise challenging issues, address misperception and miscommunication and explore working with the Chinese where our interests intersect,” one official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, told the Reuters news agency. The meetings are likely to cover a range of issues, including the Israel-Hamas conflict, the\\xa0Ukraine war and the escalating tension\\xa0in the South China Sea, senior administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press news agency. Washington is sending military aid to Israel and Ukraine, while Beijing has grown closer to Russia since the Ukraine war began in February 2022, and has called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. A second official said the US would “push the Chinese to take a more constructive approach on both”. Wang held phone calls with the foreign ministers of Israel and the Palestinian Authority on Monday and expressed sadness at the civilian suffering as a result of the conflict. He reiterated China’s calls for a ceasefire and backing for a two-state solution. Washington has placed importance on China’s ability to influence Iran. Blinken, during his whirlwind trip last week to the Middle East, held a phone call with Wang asking him to use Beijing’s influence in the region to ensure the conflict does not widen. Wang’s trip takes place about three weeks ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco, where there are expectations that President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping might meet. The US officials did not confirm the leaders’ meeting, nor did they say if Wang’s visit would prepare for such a meeting. Instead, Wang’s trip was described as reciprocal to Blinken’s visit to Beijing. Beijing has yet to confirm if Xi will travel to San Francisco for the annual APEC summit. US-China relations have been deteriorating since 2018 over issues such as trade, the situation in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, the militarisation of the South China Sea, the rising pressure on the self-governed island of Taiwan and the origins of COVID-19. Biden and Xi last met in November 2022 on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting in Indonesia. At that time, they agreed to resume talks, set up work groups on specific issues and expand person-to-person exchanges. US officials said territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas were also likely to be on the agenda, saying that Washington was deeply concerned by China’s “destabilising and dangerous actions” in the South China Sea. The Philippines, a key US ally, this week accused Chinese coastguard vessels of “intentionally” colliding with its vessels on a resupply mission at Second Thomas Shoal, in the most serious incident this year. Beijing claims the shoal as its territory although it lies within Manila’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Re-establishing military-to-military ties with China also remains a top concern for the US, the officials said, adding that this meant sustained communications throughout the ranks. Defence Minister Li Shangfu, who has not been seen in public for nearly two months amid a corruption probe, had snubbed US calls to meet. He had been targeted with US sanctions in 2018 over Russian weapons purchases.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has submitted a bill on Sweden’s NATO membership bid to parliament, after months of back-and-forth with Western countries over the issue. Erdogan told his NATO allies at a summit in July that he would send the legislation to the Turkish parliament when it reconvened on October 1, having previously raised objections over a range of security concerns. Since parliament reopened, however, Turkish officials have repeatedly said Stockholm needed to take more concrete steps to clamp down on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) armed group, which has been designated a “terrorist organisation” by Turkey, the European Union and the United States. “The Protocol on Sweden’s NATO Accession was signed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on October 23, 2023 and referred to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey,” the presidency said on social media platform X on Monday. Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson welcomed the development. “Now it remains for the parliament to deal with the question,” Kristersson said on social media platform X. “We look forward to being a NATO member.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he looked forward to a “speedy vote” in the Turkish parliament. There is no set timeframe for ratification. The bill will be put on the agenda of parliament’s foreign affairs commission, which will have to pass it before it can be sent to the general assembly for ratification. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Sweden and Finland abandoned their long-standing non-aligned status and asked to join NATO in May 2022. In order for new countries to join the transatlantic military alliance, all 31 current NATO members must endorse their efforts. Finland’s request was approved by all members, and it became a NATO member in April. Sweden’s bid for membership has been ratified by all members apart from Hungary and Turkey. Erdogan had accused Stockholm of being too soft on the PKK and other groups his country considers to be security threats. Turkey also was angered by a series of Quran-burning protests in Sweden. Turkey’s foreign ministry called the events a “despicable attack” and called for “decisive measures to prevent this hate crime” in a statement issued at the time. In July, Sweden’s Supreme Court rejected an extradition request from Turkey for two men accused of membership in the movement of US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Turkey blames for a failed coup effort in 2016.      \\xa0 Turkey lifted its opposition after US President Joe Biden’s administration signalled it would let Turkey buy 40 new F-16 fighter jets and modernisation kits from the US. Ankara also received assurances from Sweden that it would help revive Turkey’s own quest to join the EU. Under the deal, NATO as an organisation agreed to address Turkey’s concerns about “terrorism”. Stoltenberg said he had appointed an assistant secretary-general to serve as his special coordinator in this effort.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '23 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The journalist is accused of failing to register as a ‘foreign agent’, a charge watchdogs have called ‘spurious’. A Russian court has ruled that Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva should remain in detention until early December, adding to what rights groups say is a crackdown on media in the country. Kurmasheva, an editor for the US government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s (RFE/RL’s) Tatar-Bashkir service, was arrested by Russian law enforcement in the central city of Kazan on October 18. She is accused of failing to register as a “foreign agent” and collecting information on the Russian military, Russia’s state-run news site Tatar-Inform reported. If convicted, she faces up to five years in prison. On Sunday, a district court in Kazan ruled Kurmasheva must be held for six more weeks as a “preventative measure” in advance of her trial. RFE/RL acting president, Jeffrey Gedmin, said the organisation was “disappointed” by Kurmasheva’s prolonged detention and called for her “immediate release”. Kurmasheva is the second American journalist to face charges in Russia this year, following the arrest in March of Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reporter Evan Gershkovich on “espionage” charges. Gershkovich, who is being held in Moscow’s Lefortovo prison, is the first American charged with spying in Russia since the end of the Cold War. His lawyers, the WSJ, and the White House have all dismissed the allegations, with the US government blaming Russia for “harassing US citizens”.      Press freedom groups and independent journalists have denounced Russia’s targeting of media members, which they say has intensified since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), an independent, New York-based non-profit that advocates for correspondents around the world, called the charges against Kurmasheva “spurious” and urged for them to be dropped. “CPJ is deeply concerned by the detention of US-Russian journalist Alsu Kurmasheva on spurious criminal charges and calls on Russian authorities to release her immediately and drop all charges against her,” said Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia programme coordinator. .@pressfreedom is deeply concerned by Wednesday’s detention of @RFERL journalist Alsu Kurmasheva in the western #Russian city of Kazan and calls on #Russian authorities to release her immediately.https://t.co/wKcchSDybX#FreeThePress — CPJ Europe and Central Asia (@CPJ_Eurasia) October 18, 2023  Kurmasheva, who is based at RFE/RL’s headquarters in the Czech capital, Prague, was stopped at Kazan international airport on June 2 on her arrival in Russia to attend to a family emergency, the media outlet said. Officials confiscated her passports and issued her a fine for not registering her US passport with Russian authorities, RFE/RL said. She was awaiting the return of her passports when the new charges were announced earlier this month. Russia told RFE/RL to declare itself as a foreign agent in 2017 but the media organisation has contested Moscow’s application of foreign agent laws in the European Court of Human Rights. Dmitry Kolezev, an independent Russian journalist, wrote that the criminal article being used against Kurmasheva effectively required her to voluntarily declare herself a “foreign agent”. He had previously called the article, which is rarely used, “treason light”. Russia’s Federal Security Service has declared an extremely broad spectrum of information to be sensitive to national interests, he wrote, and a foreign agent can now be anyone who has simply “fallen under foreign influence”. “This is a law by which anyone can be convicted at all,” he said, adding: “In general, they’ve taken another hostage.” Hundreds of journalists have gone into exile since Russia launched the invasion of Ukraine, with state censors closing many respected independent media outlets and launching criminal cases against prominent journalists and regional bloggers.

       "  'Text': 'At least 14 people were injured in the Russian missile strike on an ‘ordinary civilian’ site, Kyiv says. Six people were killed and at least 14 injured when Russian missiles hit a postal distribution centre in Ukraine’s northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have said. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on the Telegram messaging app that the strike on Saturday hit an “ordinary civilian” site. He shared a video showing a building with blown-out windows and heavy structural damage, with the logo of Ukraine’s Nova Poshta postal service in the background. Victims of the attack are being treated for shrapnel injuries and seven are in serious condition and “fighting for their lives,” regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. The injured are aged between 17 and 42, Syniehubov said. Syniehubov added that postal workers had been unable to seek shelter from the strike because the building was hit just seconds after a warning siren sounded. “The Russians have inflicted more terror on Kharkiv’s peaceful population,” he said on Telegram. The regional prosecutor’s office said the depot had been struck by two S-300 missiles fired by Moscow’s forces in Russia’s Belgorod region, north of Kharkiv. Kharkiv is Ukraine’s second-largest city and just 30km (19 miles) from the Russian border. The city was the site of heavy bombing by Russia in February 2022, in the early days of the Russian full-scale invasion. Russia did not immediately comment on the missile strike but it has denied targeting civilians and civilian buildings since it launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour last year.

       "  'Text': 'More than $9bn would be set aside for humanitarian assistance in Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza. US President Joe Biden has submitted a request to Congress for more than $105bn to provide humanitarian and military aid to Israel and Ukraine, humanitarian assistance for Gaza and for immigration enforcement on the United States border with Mexico. The White House issued the funding request on Friday, following a speech from Biden the day before in which he argued that US security is connected to the success of Ukraine and Israel. “This budget request is critical to advancing America’s national security and ensuring the safety of the American people,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Friday, echoing comments from Biden’s speech.      The comments come as Israel continues to bombard the beseiged Gaza Strip in response to a Hamas attack in southern Israel that killed at least 1,400 people, according to Israeli officials. The Palestinian Ministry of Health has said that 4,137 people have been killed in the Israeli bombardment, and humanitarian conditions in Gaza have reached critical levels as medical workers plead for fuel and assistance that has yet to materialise. The Israeli campaign has sparked protests across the Middle East region, and critics have accused the US of turning a blind eye to violations of international law. Biden’s request also faces complex political circumstances in Washington, where Republicans in the House of Representatives have struggled for more than two weeks to select a candidate for the vital role of House speaker. Some in the Republican Party have also mounted resistance to further US assistance to Ukraine, a dilemma Biden may hope to bypass by attaching Ukrainian aid to support for Israel and US border enforcement with Mexico, both important issues for the conservative party. The largest part of the spending package is dedicated to Ukraine, with more than $61bn for that purpose. More than $14bn would go towards Israel, much of it for the country’s air defence system known as “the Iron Dome” and other weapons purchases. More than $9bn would be set aside for humanitarian assistance in Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza, and nearly $14bn would go towards US border enforcement. “The world is watching and the American people rightly expect their leaders to come together and deliver on these priorities,” said Biden’s budget director, Shalanda Young, in a letter to interim House Speaker Patrick McHenry. “I urge Congress to address them as part of a comprehensive, bipartisan agreement in the weeks ahead.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '20 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'President addresses US in rare Oval Office speech and explains why country should back Ukraine and Israel. United States President Joe Biden has said he will ask Congress for more money to support Israel and Ukraine, asserting in an impassioned speech that both nations were fighting enemies of democracy. Speaking to\\xa0 Americans from the Oval Office, Biden sought to make a link between the actions of Hamas in Israel and those of Russian president Vladimir Putin who sent his troops into Ukraine for a full-scale invasion in February 2022. Biden said stopping such aggression was crucial not only for the security of the US but also for the wider world. “Hamas and Putin represent different threats but they share this in common; they both want to annihilate a neighbouring democracy,” he said. He said if the US walked away and aggressors succeeded, others might be “emboldened to try the same” spreading the risk of conflict to other parts of the world. “American leadership is what holds the world together,” the president said during the 10-minute speech, only the second he has made from the Oval Office during his administration. “American alliances are what keep us, America, safe. American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with.” Biden was speaking hours after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv, where he reiterated US support for Israel even amid its total blockade of Gaza and relentless bombardment of the Palestinian enclave of 2.3 million people.      The visit had been meant to include a meeting with Arab leaders but the talks were cancelled after Gaza’s Al-Ahli Arab Hospital was hit hours before, killing some 500 people. Amid calls for a ceasefire, Biden was able to secure a commitment from Israel and Egypt to open the Rafah crossing for desperately needed humanitarian aid. Biden said he would be lodging an urgent request to Congress to support Israel and Ukraine on Friday.\\xa0 He did not put a value to the security package, but reports have suggested it could be as much as $100bn. “It’s a smart investment that will pay dividends for American security for generations,” the president stressed. Biden’s address comes amid paralysis in Congress where Republicans, who control the lower house, have struggled to appoint a new House of Representatives Speaker after removing Kevin McCarthy earlier this month. He said politicians needed to rise above “petty, partisan, angry politics” and meet their responsibilities. A small group of ultra-conservative Republicans have become increasingly vocal about their opposition to continued funding for Ukraine, but analysts said the US public remained broadly supportive of the initiative and Biden’s speech would probably win over more people. “This dysfunction in the House is viewed very unfavourably by the US people and I suspect that the Republicans will be forced, if only for concern about their electoral chances next year, to resolve this within the next two weeks,” John Herbst, senior director at the Atlantic Council and a former diplomat, told Al Jazeera. The conflict in Gaza erupted on October 7, when Hamas launched a surprise attack against Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking dozens captive. At least 3,785 Palestinians have been killed in the bombing campaign. Biden accused Hamas of unleashing “pure, unadulterated evil” on the world, and stressed that there was “‘no higher priority” for him as president than bringing home the US citizens being held by the armed group. While making clear his support for Israel, Biden said he was “heartbroken” by the “tragic loss” of Palestinian lives and that he had spoken with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to reiterate that the US remains “committed to the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and right to self-determination”.      He stressed the urgent need for humanitarian assistance to the enclave and noted the agreement secured to get food, water and medicine into Gaza. “We cannot give up on peace,” he said. “We cannot give up on the two-state solution. Israel and the Palestinians equally deserve to live in safety, dignity and peace.” Biden’s speech at the Oval Office came after he again reassured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of US support for Kyiv in its bid to push Russian forces from Ukrainian territory. He noted that the US was an “essential” part of a group of about 50 countries that have backed Ukraine since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion. Will make sure Ukraine has the “weapons they need to defend themselves”, he said, stressing to his domestic audience that there were no plans to send US troops to Eastern Europe. “When Putin invaded Ukraine he thought he could take Kyiv and the whole of Ukraine in a matter of days, but Putin has failed, and he will continue to fail,” Biden said. “Kyiv still stands because of the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Ukraine has regained more than 50 percent of the territory Russian troops once occupied.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

The outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) said in a statement on Thursday that Alsu Kurmasheva, an editor and a dual citizen of Russia and the United States, faces up to five years in prison. “Alsu is a highly respected colleague, devoted wife, and dedicated mother to two children,” said RFE/RL acting President Jeffrey Gedmin in a dual statement with the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a press freedom group. “She needs to be released so she can return to her family immediately.” .@pressfreedom is deeply concerned by Wednesday’s detention of @RFERL journalist Alsu Kurmasheva in the western #Russian city of Kazan and calls on #Russian authorities to release her immediately.https://t.co/wKcchSDybX#FreeThePress — CPJ Europe and Central Asia (@CPJ_Eurasia) October 18, 2023  US State Department spokesman Matt Miller told reporters that the arrest “appears to be another case of the Russian government harassing US citizens”. “We have not been officially notified by the government of Russia about this arrest,” he said. Russia has tightened controls over the media following its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, designating many reporters as “foreign agents”. Kurmasheva, who works for RFE/RL’s Tatar-Bashkir Service, is the second US reporter to be detained by Russia this year, after Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was arrested in March on espionage charges. Press freedom groups and the US government have strongly criticised such detentions as a form of stifling dissent. CPJ called the charges against Kurmasheva “spurious” in its statement with RFE/RL. “CPJ is deeply concerned by the detention of US-Russian journalist Alsu Kurmasheva on spurious criminal charges and calls on Russian authorities to release her immediately and drop all charges against her,” said Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia programme coordinator. Tatar-Inform, a state-held news agency in the Tatarstan republic, has reported that Kurmasheva is being held in a temporary detention centre. The outlet says that Russian authorities have accused Kurmasheva of collecting information on the Russian military to pass along to foreign sources.      Kurmasheva, who lives in Prague, travelled to Russia on May 20 for a family emergency, RFE/RL said. She was stopped at Kazan International Airport on June 2, where officials confiscated her passport and administered a fine for failing to register her US passport with Russian authorities, the outlet said. The editor was awaiting the return of her passports when new charges were announced on Wednesday.

       "  'Date': '18 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Republican Jim Jordan is set for his second bid to be elected speaker after he fell short by 17 votes in the first round vote on Tuesday. The US House of Representatives is entering its third week with no leader after right-wing Republicans ousted the former speaker, leaving the body unable to take action on key issues including the wars in Ukraine and Israel-Palestine. Former House Speaker McCarthy was voted out on October 3 after angering far-right members of his own party by partnering with Democrats to pass a debt ceiling bill that narrowly averted a government shutdown. Ever since, the fiercely divided House, which requires a majority vote from present members to select its leader, has been unable to coalesce around a new speaker. The dysfunction means it likely cannot pass bills or greenlight resolutions needed to direct aid overseas. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican from Georgia, said the picture looks dire and advocated awarding more powers to Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry to ease the crisis. “We can’t sit around and suck our thumbs and hope the world will wait until the House Republicans get their act together,” he told Fox News. On Tuesday, right-wing Republican Jim Jordan fell short in his first bid for the position by 17 votes, with 20 of his own party members defecting. All 212 Democrats in the body cast their ballots for their party’s Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Jordan is set to push forward with a second bid for the leadership role on Wednesday, but it remains unclear if he has built up enough additional support to come out on top. At least one Republican who voted against Jordan on Tuesday, Representative Doug LaMalfa, agreed to support his bid in the second round, but that would still leave him far short of the 17 additional votes he needs. The House was set to convene at 11:00am EST (15:00 GMT) for the vote. Jordan, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee who was endorsed by former US President Donald Trump, will be expected to show significant progress. But the holdouts appear to be dug in. Jordan’s Republican opponents met after voting against him and nearly all reaffirmed their objections, with some predicting he could lose another 10 Republicans. The Ohio lawmaker has little of the goodwill among the rank and file that McCarthy spent years cultivating, and it is unlikely that they would indulge him in the 15 rounds of voting that it took to get his predecessor elected. There is momentum behind a push to appoint caretaker Speaker McHenry for a limited period – expanding his purely ceremonial powers so that he can bring legislation to the floor. Lawmakers are expected to vote on a motion to formally elect McHenry – probably until the end of the year or until a permanent speaker is elected – if the second speaker vote doesn’t go Jordan’s way. “After two weeks without a speaker of the House and no clear candidate with 217 votes in the Republican conference, it is time to look at other viable options,” Ohio congressman Dave Joyce said in a statement reported by the political newspaper The Hill. “By empowering Patrick McHenry as Speaker Pro Tempore we can take care of our ally Israel until a new Speaker is elected.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Russian forces mounted new assaults against Avdiivka and Lyman in the east, but Ukrainian defenders held the line in the 86th week of war. Russia sought to break out of its diplomatic isolation, resupply its dwindling weapons stockpiles, and take back the military initiative it lost this year in the 86th week of its war in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to celebrate the 10th anniversary of China’s Belt and Road initiative, which aimed to develop rail, road and port infrastructure across Eurasia to facilitate the export of Chinese goods. Xi is one of Putin’s few allies, but while there he also met Hungarian premier Viktor Orban, in a symbolic gesture of support for the Kremlin from one of Ukraine’s purported allies. “Hungary has never wanted to confront Russia,” Orban said. “Hungary’s goal has always been to establish and mutually expand the best contacts,” he said. More ominously, Putin has been receiving substantial shipments of ammunition from North Korea, the White House said. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on October 13 that as many as 1,000 containers’ worth of North Korean weapons may have reached Russia between September 7 and October 1. The Washington Post’s analysis was that shipments had begun earlier, after high-level meetings between Russian and North Korean officials in mid-August, and that the shipments were greater than what Kirby suggested. Satellite images the Washington Post published on October 16 suggested that two Russian ships had successfully transported cargoes from the North Korean free trade zone port of Rason to Russia’s port of Dunai several times since August. “This will have a very serious effect on the trajectory of the war [in Ukraine],” Jack Watling, senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told the newspaper. “North Korea has the ability to manufacture a lot of ammunition, and it has significant stockpiles,” he said. North Korea reportedly manufactures 122mm Grad rockets and 122mm artillery rounds. Kirby also said Russia may have reciprocated in kind. Pyongyang has sought “fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armoured vehicles” and “ballistic missile production equipment” from Russia, he said, and there was evidence that Russian containers had flowed towards Pyongyang. Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have been wooing each other for some time. Putin met Kim at the Vostochny Comsodrome in Russia’s far east on September 13. Kim was reportedly interested in Russian satellite technology, and pledged to stand with Russia in the “fight against imperialism”. North Korea failed to launch spy satellites in May and August because of second- and third-stage flight issues. The relationship appears to be warming. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov arrived in Pyongyang on October 18 in apparent preparation for a trip by Putin. Russia said it could decide to provide the same long-range, nuclear-capable ballistic missile technology Kim is interested in to Iran. A 2015 ban on the transfer of such technology expired on October 18. “Supplies to and from Iran of products falling under the Missile Technology Control Regime no longer require prior approval by the UN Security Council,” Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. Ukraine also received military technology during the week. On Tuesday, October 17, the Pentagon confirmed that all 31 M1 Abrams tanks it had pledged were on Ukrainian soil. On the same day, Ukraine fired the first 18 Army Tactical Missiles (ATACMS) sent by the US, with 160km (100-mile) range. The missiles apparently landed on airfields in the Russian-occupied port of Berdyansk and Russian-occupied Luhansk city. Russian forces launched a new effort to capture the eastern city of Avdiivka on October 10. They have long succeeded in forming a pincer to its north and south, but Ukrainian defenders have held them at bay. Russian forces attacked with armoured assault units, helicopters and concentrated artillery in 10 or 12 directions at once, said the head of the city’s military administration, Vitaliy Barabash. Artillery barrages were so continuous as to prevent rescue crews from recovering the bodies of those killed. “They are striking with everything they have. Bouts of shooting, artillery, multiple rocket launchers, mortars and a lot of aircraft,” Barabash, told national television. “Operations cannot take place in such conditions. It is frightening to leave because the road is under fire. And no easier to stay as there is no place, no basement that can withstand the strikes.” Russian forces had captured 4.52sq km (1.75sq miles) around Avdiivka and were 5.25km (3.2 miles) and 3.32km (2.06 miles) away from key Ukrainian supply routes to the north and south, respectively, assessed the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. At the same time, Russian forces were attempting to break through Ukraine’s defences in the Lyman-Kupyansk area, at the northeastern end of the front. The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said there had been a sharp increase in fighting. “The enemy is preparing, seriously preparing for offensive actions, bringing in staff,” Syrskyi said in the footage posted on the Telegram messaging app. “The main goal is to break through our troops’ defences and recapture our territory.” Ukraine appeared to be holding its own. Neither Russian nor Ukrainian sources indicated any major territorial changes, and Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to temper expectations by calling the action around Avdiivka an “active defence” on national television. “Both Ukrainian military observers and Russian sources stated that Russian forces did not achieve their desired immediate breakthrough, and Russian forces faced initial high losses and a likely slower than anticipated rate of advance,” said the ISW. Military observers also assessed that Russia had suffered losses of at least three dozen tanks and armoured vehicles – equivalent to a battalion. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on October 13 that the new Russian offensives near Lyman and Avdiivka “did not come as a surprise,” and said Ukraine would repel them. Meanwhile, Ukraine kept up its own counteroffensive in the south and east, making marginal advances according to Ukrainian official sources. Russian sources said Ukraine mounted attacks on the front-line village of Verbove in the south, on October 15 and 16. Geolocated footage published on October 15 showed that Ukrainian forces marginally advanced towards the railway line north of Klishchiivka, beside the fiercely contested eastern city of Bakhmut. Ukrainian forces also harassed Russian positions south of Bakhmut on October 14. Damage to the Baltic Connector gas pipeline was likely caused by interference, said Finnish officials on October 15. The pipeline, which runs between Finland and Estonia was shut down on Sunday. “It is likely that the damage to both the gas pipe and the communication cable is the result of external activity,” President Sauli Niinisto of Finland said in a\\xa0statement. “The cause of the damage is not yet clear.” The incident raised the spectre of sabotage, similar to that which destroyed a section of the Nordstream 2 pipeline in September 2022. There was good news for four Ukrainian families during the week. Qatar succeeded in securing the release of four Ukrainian children abducted by Russian forces, after mediating with Russia at Ukraine’s request. The children, aged two to 17, were to travel to Ukraine via various routes after reaching Qatar’s embassy in Moscow. Two had already arrived home on October 16.

Lavrov’s visit to North Korea comes days after the US expressed concern that Pyongyang is supplying Moscow with weapons, in return for a range of military assistance, including advanced technologies. Washington claimed on Friday that North Korea has delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia in recent weeks.      The US allegations have been denied by both North Korea and the Kremlin. “Russia, as a responsible member of the world community, strictly adheres to its international obligations towards Pyongyang through the UN Security Council,” Russian Ambassador at Large Oleg Burmistrov said. “At the same time, we are categorically against the introduction of new restrictive measures,” he added. Putin and Kim heaped praise upon one another during their September meeting, with the North Korean leader fully backing Russia in its war with Ukraine and wishing the Russian president victory against the “imperialists’ anti-Russia scheme”. Putin claimed that there were areas of potential military collaboration between the two states in spite of numerous UN sanctions against North Korea over its weapons and ballistic missile programme. “There are certain restrictions. Russia complies with all these restrictions. But there are things that we can talk about … Under the current rules, we also have opportunities, which we see and discuss,” the Russian president said. Putin and Lavrov’s engagement in Asia is part of a push by Moscow to deepen ties throughout the continent as geopolitical tensions persist over its war in Ukraine. On Tuesday, Putin accepted an invitation from Vietnamese President Vo Van Thuong to visit Hanoi, a key Russian ally and arms purchaser. However, Moscow’s diplomatic drive in East Asia could be eclipsed by the escalating war in Gaza, which saw an air strike kill at least 500 civilians at a crowded hospital on Tuesday night. Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman said Russia considered the attack “as a crime – as an act of dehumanisation”. It also comes as Russia faces criticism for an air strike in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia that killed at least two civilians and wiped out two floors of a residential building. A Russian official in the city cast blame for the attack on Ukrainian forces.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Chinese president notes that he and Putin have met 42 times in the past decade and developed a ‘deep friendship’. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has told Russian President Vladimir Putin the “political mutual trust” between their countries was “continuously deepening” as the two men met for bilateral talks in Beijing. State news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday that Xi also called for joint efforts by China and Russia to “safeguard international fairness” and “justice” as he hailed “close and effective strategic coordination” between their two countries. Xi noted that he and Putin had met “42 times in the past 10 years and [had] developed a good working relationship and a deep friendship”. The two leaders last met in March when Xi travelled to Moscow. The two men spoke at that time of a “new era” of cooperation, building on the “no-limits” partnership they announced in 2022 days before Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Their Beijing meeting comes as Kyiv continues a counteroffensive to remove Russian troops from its territory amid a worsening crisis over the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. China’s Middle East envoy Zhai Jun is due to travel to the region soon. “The visit aims to help with de-escalation in the Middle East,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters at a regular briefing on Tuesday without going into further detail. “This is part of China’s efforts to promote peace talks.” Putin told Xi that China had a crucial role to play in foreign policy. “In the current difficult conditions, close foreign policy coordination is especially necessary – which is what we are doing, and today we will also discuss all of this,” the Russian leader said. The meeting is taking place on the sidelines of a forum to mark 10 years of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a globe-spanning infrastructure development policy that is one of Xi’s signature policies. Leaders and senior politicians from some 130 countries are in the Chinese capital for the event, which opened on Wednesday. China is Russia’s largest trading partner, with the exchange between the nations reaching a record $190bn last year, Beijing customs data shows. Putin is on a mission to strengthen the two countries’ already strong bond, although experts say Moscow is increasingly the junior partner in the relationship. Beijing has attempted to position itself as a mediator in the Ukraine war, but it has refused to condemn Russia’s full-scale invasion, which began in February 2022.

       "  'Text': 'President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirms that Kyiv used US-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed that Kyiv used US-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles on the battlefield against Russian forces. “Today, special thanks to the United States. Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented. Very accurately – ATACMS proved themselves,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly address on Tuesday. The comments come after Kyiv’s military said Ukrainian forces struck airfields in Russian-held territory in eastern and southern Ukraine, destroying helicopters, knocking out an air defence missile launcher and damaging runways. Ukraine said it carried out “well-aimed strikes on enemy airfields” near the eastern city of Luhansk and the southern city of Berdiansk overnight, but gave few details. The country’s Special Operations Forces said nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher and other equipment had been destroyed, runways had been hit, and heavy losses had been inflicted on Russian forces. Russia’s Defence Ministry did not mention the attacks. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in the Zaporizhia region that is partly controlled by Moscow, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian air defences had ensured the attack on the Berdiansk airfield was not successful. A Ukrainian lawmaker said the US-supplied ATACMS missiles were used in the attack on the airfield in Berdiansk. For months, Ukraine has pushed the US to provide it with ATACMS as it seeks to expel Russian forces from its territory. The US had previously held off on providing Ukraine with the long-range missiles, fearing their use could risk an escalation of the conflict. ATACMS is already with us. The airfield in Berdyansk with enemy equipment was hit by them. Thanks to our partners! And Russians are already publishing photos 😀 pic.twitter.com/6SVwPPhHz9 — Oleksiy Goncharenko (@GoncharenkoUa) October 17, 2023  Several US news outlets reported that ATACMS had been sent to and deployed by Ukraine. Politico reported that Washington had “secretly shipped” them over the last several weeks. Washington had previously hesitated to send the long-range missiles to Ukraine, partly due to concerns that they could enable Ukrainian strikes within Russian territory. Russia itself had warned against sending longer-range missiles, with the Russian foreign ministry calling them a “red line” that would make the US “party to the conflict” in September 2022. Kyiv, for its part, insisted that ATACMS could play a vital role in its efforts to disrupt Russian supply lines, air bases, and rail networks within occupied Ukrainian territory. The Biden administration’s apparent reversal signals continued US support as Ukraine fights to make progress in a counteroffensive launched in June. The counteroffensive has made only gradual gains through vast Russian minefields and heavily entrenched Russian positions, and Kyiv says Moscow is attacking in some areas ahead of the second winter since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday that Russia was hoping to advance as far as possible towards the town of Kupiansk in northeastern Ukraine before winter, and that fighting continued around the town of Avdiivka on the eastern front. Kyiv says its forces are holding their ground, including around Avdiivka and Kupiansk.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban have underscored their countries’ strong ties ahead of an international forum in Beijing, saying that continuing “geopolitical tensions” due to the war in Ukraine do not affect their relationship. “Despite the fact that in the current geopolitical conditions, the possibilities for keeping contact and developing relations are very limited, it cannot but cause satisfaction that our ties with many European countries are maintained and developed,” Putin said, according to Russian news agencies. “One of those countries is Hungary.” Hungary, which is a member of the European Union and NATO but also has close ties with Moscow, has had its allegiances put to the test over the war in Ukraine. Since Russia’s invasion, Budapest has blocked weapons from passing through its territory to reach Ukraine and deepened energy ties with Moscow despite EU sanctions on Russian oil. Budapest is expected to play a decisive role in Ukraine’s bid to join the EU, positioning itself as a potential opponent to a December vote on accession talks. The EU is considering releasing billions of dollars in aid to Hungary that has been blocked over alleged rule-of-law violations in order to win Hungary over on the vote, which requires unanimous approval from EU members. Hungary is expected to use the Beijing summit as an opportunity to shore up close energy ties with Russia, from which it receives at least 80 percent of its gas. During Putin and Orban’s meeting, the leaders discussed gas and oil shipments and nuclear energy issues, Orban’s press chief Bertalan Havasi told the Reuters news agency. Orban also reportedly stressed the need for an end to sanctions on Russia and the fighting in Ukraine. The two leaders are joining numerous Southeast Asian and African leaders in Beijing for a two-day event celebrating the 10th anniversary of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a mammoth infrastructure development strategy that spans more than 150 countries.

       " {'Title': 'Vladimir Putin to meet Xi Jinping in Beijing: Five things to know',\n",
       "  'Date': '17 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Ties between Russia and China have deepened in recent years. Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in Beijing and is scheduled to hold bilateral talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Wednesday. Ties between Russia and China have deepened in recent years, and Putin and Xi have developed a strong personal friendship. The two men last met in March in Moscow. Putin’s trip to China during which he will take part in a forum to mark 10 years of the Belt and Road Initiative, is the first time this year that the Russian leader has travelled to a country beyond those that were once part of the former Soviet Union. “(The) Russian delegation’s presence in Beijing is important for Moscow,” Alicja Bachulska, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told the AFP news agency. “It will legitimise Russia in the international arena by creating a positive image of Putin not being completely isolated in the context of war.” Here are five things to know: Xi and Putin forged their friendship when the pair shared cake and vodka shots to mark the Russian leader’s birthday at a summit in Indonesia in 2013. They have since drawn closer, with Xi accompanying Putin on a high-speed train ride across China to make traditional steamed buns five years later, and the two men eating caviar-topped blini during a river cruise when Xi later visited Russia. In 2019, the Russian leader threw Xi a birthday party, surprising him with ice cream at a conference in Tajikistan. On a visit to Moscow the same year, Xi told Russian media: “President Putin is the foreign colleague that I have interacted with most extensively. He is my best friend, and I greatly treasure our friendship.” In an interview with Chinese state media ahead of the latest visit, Putin was effusive in his praise for Xi, praising the relevance and significance of Xi’s policies and vision of a multipolar world. Broadcaster CGTN said that Putin described Xi as a “true world leader”. The two men were born just a few months apart in the early 1950s. While Xi was the scion of a family of communist revolutionaries, Putin was born in more humble circumstances before becoming an intelligence officer in the Soviet Union. Both men found lessons in the collapse of the USSR – for Putin, it was a humiliation and a “major geopolitical disaster” and for Xi, a cautionary tale for China’s own Communist Party. In line with their leaders’ deepening friendship, China and Russia have also moved closer. Putin was last in Beijing in February 2022, just days before he sent thousands of troops across the border into Ukraine in what he called a “special military operation”. At that time the two men signed an agreement promising a “no-limits” relationship. By March this year, they were talking of a “new era” of cooperation. Russia is now China’s second-largest trade partner outside Asia, and trade between the two countries surged 30 percent in the first half of this year, Russian Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said on a visit to China. Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said that from China’s view, “Russia is a safe neighbour that is friendly, that is a source of cheap raw materials, that’s a support for Chinese initiatives on the global stage and that’s also a source of military technologies, some of those that China doesn’t have.” “For Russia, China is its lifeline, economic lifeline in its brutal repression against Ukraine,” Gabuev told The Associated Press news agency. Putin comes to Beijing amid expectations that Israel could soon launch a ground invasion of the blockaded Palestinian enclave of Gaza. The issue was high on the agenda when the Russian and Chinese foreign ministers held talks in Beijing on Monday, with both calling for intensified efforts to avoid a humanitarian disaster. “It is imperative that a ceasefire be put in place, that the two sides be brought back to the negotiating table, and that an emergency humanitarian channel be established to prevent a further humanitarian disaster,” Wang said at the meeting, according to a Chinese transcript of the meeting. A Russian-drafted UN Security Council resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire failed to get the minimum nine votes needed in the 15-member body on Monday, and Putin and Xi are likely to pick up the baton on the issue. Putin held multiple calls with leaders in the region on Monday including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. He told Netanyahu that Moscow wanted to help prevent a humanitarian disaster. China’s state broadcaster CCTV reported earlier that Zhai Jun, Beijing’s special envoy on the Middle East, will visit the region this week to push for a ceasefire and promote peace talks. Even amid the deepening crisis in the Middle East, Russia’s continuing conflict in Ukraine is also likely to feature in the talks between the two men. Recent reports suggest intense fighting on the eastern front around Avdiivka, as well as in the northeastern Kupiansk-Lyman area. Beijing has sought to portray itself as a neutral party in the war and in March, about the time of Xi’s visit to Moscow, embarked on a flurry of diplomatic activity to promote its 12-point peace plan. Those efforts have made little headway and Ukraine’s allies have largely dismissed Beijing’s attempt to position itself as mediator. Still, on a visit to China that ended at the weekend, European Union policy chief Josep Borrell urged China to do what it could to end the war in Ukraine. Borrell said he had conveyed to the Chinese that the EU considered Russia “a huge threat” to its security and that the group was committed to supporting Ukraine. The EU is expected to have a summit with China before the end of the year.      Oil and gas is a key concern for Russia amid international sanctions, and the bosses of Russia’s Gazprom and Rosneft are said to be part of Putin’s delegation to Beijing. Russia is eager to secure a deal to sell more natural gas to China and plans to build the Power of Siberia-2 pipeline, which would travel through Mongolia and have an annual capacity of 50 billion cubic metres (bcm). For China, Russia is not only a major source of oil and gas: one of the world’s biggest nuclear powers is also a rich potential source of technology as its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) seeks to modernise its conventional and nuclear forces by 2035. Russian aviation, rocket and even submarine technology have been shared over recent decades with China, according to a 2022 assessment by the United States. China and Russia also cooperate closely on civilian nuclear plants.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in Beijing ahead of a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday. Xi invited his “dear friend” Putin to China’s third Belt and Road Initiative forum where the leaders of 130 countries will discuss one of Xi’s signature international projects. But the meeting’s theme is likely to be overshadowed by the Israel-Hamas war as well as Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. China is one of the first countries Putin has visited since the Hague-based International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant against him in March, accusing the Russian leader of illegally deporting children from Ukraine. China is not one of the 123 countries that are members of the ICC, so it is not obliged to transfer Putin to The Hague for trial. Earlier this month, Putin visited Kyrgyzstan but China is the first outside of former Soviet republic countries he has visited this year. Kyrgyzstan is also not an ICC member.      Beijing has rejected Western criticism of its partnership with Moscow even as the war in Ukraine continues, insisting that their ties do not violate international norms and that China has the right to collaborate with whichever country it chooses. Trade between neighbouring China and Russia has been soaring since Moscow began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with Beijing importing Russian oil after other countries placed sanctions on Russian imports. In an interview with Chinese state broadcaster CGTN ahead of his visit this week, Putin said that a “multipolar world is taking shape, and the concepts and initiatives put forward by President Xi Jinping are highly relevant and significant”, CGTN reported. Russia’s top diplomat Sergey Lavrov has arrived in Beijing ahead of Putin and held talks with China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday. Xi and Putin last met in Russia in March this year. Speaking at the Kremlin during that visit, Xi told Putin, “Right now there are changes – the likes of which we haven’t seen for 100 years – and we are the ones driving these changes together.” Putin last visited China for the Beijing Winter Olympics in February 2022 when Russia and China released a sweeping 5,000-word statement reaffirming their no-limits relationship – days before the Russian president sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine. It is the third time Putin has attended the Belt and Road forum, which continues until Wednesday. He attended the two previous meetings in 2017 and 2019. Putin has also accepted an invitation from leader Kim Jong Un to visit North Korea after the two presidents met in Russia last month.

Qatar has announced that its mediators have succeeded in securing Russian agreement for the return of four Ukrainian children to their families in what is hoped to be the first phase of repatriations for more children. The children, who range in age from two to 17, have been received at the Qatari mission in Moscow which “facilitated the hosting of the children and their families…and accompanied them to their destination”, according to a statement by the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This first repatriation of Ukrainian children is part of a longer-term mechanism Qatar negotiated with both sides after months of secret talks, according to a Qatari official who spoke to Reuters. Commenting on the repatriation, Qatari Minister of State for International Cooperation Lolwah al-Khater said in a statement: “Today, we celebrate the power of unity as we witness the reunification of children and their families. I extend my deepest gratitude to the State of Russia… and the State of Ukraine… Their tireless efforts, alongside the State of Qatar’s commitment, have been instrumental in facilitating this heartwarming success. “We stand resolute in our commitment to this humanitarian cause and hope that our collaboration remains an inspiring symbol of hope and compassion.” Ukraine says up to 20,000 children have been taken by Russia into the country or territory that it holds. In May 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree making it easier for Russians to adopt Ukrainian children who were “without parental care”. In March, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights, stating that it had “grounds to believe [they bear] responsibility for the war crime of … unlawful transfer of population from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation, in prejudice of Ukrainian children.” Both individuals dismissed the ICC warrants and accusations while Ukraine welcomed the court’s decision. Observers at the time worried that this would spell trouble for any future diplomatic attempts to mediate the situation, but the successful launch of this mechanism signals some hope for a solution.

       "  'Text': 'President Xi Jinping’s signature economic initiative has extended Beijing’s global reach. China is due to host representatives of 130 countries for a forum on its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that is likely to be overshadowed by the Israel-Gaza war, and the continuing conflict in Ukraine. At the top of the forum’s guest list is Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, on his first trip to a major global power since the Ukraine invasion threw his regime into international isolation, leading the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue a warrant for his arrest. Leaders began arriving in Beijing on Monday for an event showcasing the global reach of the BRI – a signature project of President Xi Jinping. While China hopes the forum will help boost its standing as a leading global power, Israel’s continued bombardment of the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip is likely to dominate the headlines. Israel declared war on Hamas after its fighters launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, killing more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, and taking others captive.      Gaza has been under attack ever since with entire neighbourhoods flattened. More than one million people have fled their homes amid expectations that Israel will soon launch a ground offensive. At least 2,670 people have been killed in Gaza. China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi has condemned Israel’s actions for going “beyond the scope of self-defence” and called for an end to the violence. “(Israel) should listen earnestly to the calls of the international community and the UN secretary general, and cease its collective punishment of the people of Gaza,” Wang said on Sunday. Beijing has been criticised by Western officials for not specifically naming Hamas in its statements on the Israel-Gaza conflict. Wang had on Sunday spoken with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who called on China to use its “influence” in the Middle East to push for calm. China has a warm relationship with Iran, whose leaders support both Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese group that could open a second front against Israel. Earlier this year, China brokered a rapprochement between former regional foes Iran and Saudi Arabia. Beijing’s special envoy Zhai Jun will visit the Middle East this week to push for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict and promote peace talks, China’s state broadcaster CCTV said on Sunday, without specifying which countries he would visit. Niva Yau, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, told AFP the BRI summit would allow Beijing to frame attendance as a gesture of support for its position. “Any head of state that attends the summit, it’s almost as if they agree with Beijing’s positions on these global issues,” she said. \\xa0 A number of leaders have already arrived in Beijing ahead of the two-day forum, which gets under way on Tuesday. Among them are Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Kenyan President William Ruto and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. On Monday Russia’s top diplomat Sergey Lavrov flew into Beijing and within hours held talks with Wang. Putin – whose strategic dependence on China has only grown since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of neighbouring Ukraine thrust his country into international isolation – is expected to arrive overnight. This year, trade between China and Russia has soared to levels not seen since the beginning of Moscow’s war in Ukraine, with Chinese imports of Russian oil offering Moscow a critical lifeline as international sanctions bite. China has positioned itself as a neutral party, putting forward its own 12-point peace plan, but it has also refused to condemn the war and has offered Moscow vital diplomatic and financial support. At the heart of the deepening partnership is the relationship between Xi and Putin, who have described each other as “dear friends”. Their alliance is also forged by a symbiotic necessity, each seeing the other as a necessary bulwark in their shared struggle against Western dominance. In an interview with Chinese state broadcaster CGTN ahead of his visit this week, Putin hailed ties with Beijing and the “mutual benefits” of the BRI. “President Putin pointed out that a multipolar world is taking shape, and the concepts and initiatives put forward by President Xi Jinping are highly relevant and significant,” CGTN reported. “He stated that President Xi Jinping is a well-recognised leader on the world stage and is a true world leader,” the broadcaster said. Putin also reportedly “shared pleasant memories between President Xi and him, and hoped tradition continues when they meet in China in the future”.

       "  'Date': '16 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Poland should see official election results from Monday but exit polls suggest an end to eight years of nationalist rule. Polish opposition leader Donald Tusk has welcomed exit polls showing opposition parties on course to potentially secure a majority in the country’s parliamentary election over the ruling conservative nationalist party. A former European Council President, Tusk’s victory would see Poland moving closer to European allies and reviving support for Ukraine. His Civic Coalition (KO) party ran with Third Way and the New Left on separate tickets but with a shared commitment to restoring ties with Europe. The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party initially supported Ukraine but ran on a reversal of its position, apparently believing that Polish voters were growing weary of Russia’s war in the country. The Ipsos exit poll projected that while PiS would emerge as the largest party with approximately 36.8 percent of the vote, roughly equivalent to 200 seats, the KO-led opposition grouping would secure 248 of the 460 seats in Poland’s parliament, enough to form a majority. Notably, initial results suggested Sunday’s election may have also inspired a higher turnout than in 1989, when some 63 percent of Polish people voted in an election that removed communist authorities. “Democracy has won … This is the end of the PiS government,” Tusk told party members at a celebration on Sunday evening where he and others wore red hearts on their clothing. As a member of the European Union and NATO, Poland’s changing position on neighbouring Ukraine, and response to people fleeing the conflict, was being closely watched. The high turnout led to long queues at polling stations but people who were still in line when polls officially closed were reportedly still able to cast their votes.      PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski was muted in his comments at the party headquarters in central Warsaw, indicating it was not clear whether Sunday’s results would translate into another term in office. “We have to have hope that regardless of whether we are in power or in opposition, our project will continue,” said Kaczynski. “We will not let Poland lose [the] right to decide its own fate.” PiS denies its reforms have undermined democracy, saying they were meant to make the country and its economy more fair while removing the last vestiges of communism. It has built its support base on generous social handouts and a pledge of more independence from Brussels. Tusk has said he would seek to unblock about 110 billion euros of European Union funds earmarked for Poland, which have been frozen due to rule-of-law concerns, from day one if he heads a new government.

Poland is voting in a key election\\xa0that would significantly impact the country’s local and foreign policies. People headed to the ballots on Sunday, with voting expected to end at 9pm local time (19:00 GMT). Nearly 30 million people are eligible to vote and turnout is expected to be among the highest in years. The ruling United Right (ZP) coalition led by the nationalist conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party hopes will earn it an unprecedented third term in office, while the opposition warns it could put the country on a path towards leaving the European Union. Political analysts say Poland could face a period of instability if PiS fails to secure a majority.      PiS has cast the election as a choice between security from unfettered migration, which it says its opponents support, and a creeping westernisation it sees as contrary to Poland’s Catholic character. “This election will show whether Poland will be governed by Poles, or by Berlin or Brussels,” PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski told supporters at the party’s last campaign rally on Friday. “What will win is good, patriotic governance … not the screaming and hatred that fill the media and which affect weaker minds,” he said in Skarzysko-Kamienna, a city in the PiS heartland in southeastern Poland. Since sweeping to power in 2015, the party has been accused of undermining democratic checks and balances, politicising the courts, using publicly owned media to push its own propaganda, and stirring up homophobia. PiS denies wrongdoing, or wanting to leave the EU, and says its reforms aim to make the country and its economy more fair while removing the last vestiges of communism. It has built its support on generous social handouts, which it says rival parties will stop.      Its main rival, the liberal Civic Coalition (KO), led by former European Council president Donald Tusk, has campaigned on a pledge to undo PiS reforms, hold its leaders to account and resolve conflicts with Brussels over democratic rule. Tusk says his party would maintain social support. “We need change if you care about fundamental values such as trust, accountability, tolerance to dominate public life again,” Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, a senior KO official, told voters on Friday in Kalisz, in central Poland. The outcome of the elections will be important not just to Poles, but also to policymakers in the United States, across Europe, and especially to Ukraine and Russia. Poland has been central to the West’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine as it has equipped Kyiv with German-made Leopard 2 tanks and Polish MiG-29 fighters. The country has also taken in millions of Ukrainian refugees since the start of the war.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '12 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The move comes after the ROC incorporated sport bodies in four regions illegally annexed by Russia in eastern Ukraine. The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) has been suspended with immediate effect for recognising regional sport organisations from four territories annexed from Ukraine, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said. The IOC added on Thursday that the ROC would not be eligible for any funding after it recognised Olympic Councils from the regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, but that it would not affect any Russian athletes competing as neutrals. “The unilateral decision taken by the Russian Olympic Committee on 5 October 2023 to include, as its members, the regional sports organisations which are under the authority of the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of Ukraine (namely Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia) constitutes a breach of the Olympic Charter,” the IOC said in a statement. “It violates the territorial integrity of the NOC of Ukraine, as recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in accordance with the Olympic Charter.” The IOC executive board is meeting in Mumbai, India ahead of the IOC session from October 15-17. Thursday’s ruling does not affect any decision on Russian and Belarusian athletes’ participation at the Paris 2024 Olympics, which the IOC will consider at a later date. “The suspension of the ROC does not affect the participation of independent athletes,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams told a press conference on Thursday.      The Russian Olympic Committee dismissed the decision as counterproductive and politically motivated. “Today the IOC made another counterproductive decision with obvious political motivations,” the ROC said in a statement. “This secures de jure what was done de facto back in February 2022,” it added, referring to the ban on Russian athletes issued by most international sports federations in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The IOC initially banned Russia and Belarus from international sports events after Moscow invaded Ukraine that February. However, in March of this year, the IOC recommended that sports federations allow Russians and Belarusians to return, as neutral athletes in individual events, with no flag, emblem or anthem. The IOC has said athletes should not be punished for the actions of governments.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Russian leader is expected to travel to China next week after a two-day visit to Bishkek. Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in Kyrgyzstan on his first foreign trip since the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for his arrest for alleged war crimes. Putin’s two-day trip to Bishkek will culminate in his attendance at a summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), an intergovernmental organisation made up of former Soviet republics, amid claims of waning Russian influence in the region. Putin, who has rarely left Russia since sending troops into Ukraine in early 2022, is also expected to travel to China next week for the third Belt and Road Forum in Beijing. During a meeting with Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov on Thursday, Putin reiterated Russia’s importance as a trade partner and Kyrgyzstan’s biggest investor and said the two sides would further develop cooperation. “I would like to thank the president for the invitation. We have good reasons [to be here], but even without reason, this visit is long overdue,” Putin said. The Russian leader also highlighted double-digit growth in Russian-Kyrgyz trade, which some analysts in the West suspect is due to sanctions-busting by Russian businesses. Last week, the Kyrgyzstan central bank urged local banks to tighten controls to improve compliance with Western sanctions against Moscow. In July, the United States imposed sanctions on four Kyrgyz companies for re-exporting electronic components and other technology to Russia. In Kyrgyzstan, Putin is also expected to take part in a ceremonies to mark the 20th anniversary of the opening of Russia’s airbase near the town of Kant, which allows Moscow to project power in the region. The ICC in March issued a warrant for Putin and Russia’s rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, for allegedly deporting thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia. Russia, which does not recognise the ICC’s authority, has rejected the warrant as “illegal”. Kyrgyzstan and China are also not members of the ICC and therefore not bound by its jurisdiction. Still, Russia has taken precautions with foreign visits in the past, sending Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in place of Putin to the BRICS summit in August.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '11 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'In the 85th week of war, Russia ruins attacks across the front, an apparent bid to sap the progress of Kyiv’s forces. Russia launched a series of small-scale offensives in the 85th week of its war with Ukraine, appearing to try and freeze Kyiv’s four-month-old counteroffensive by fixing its forces in place. Ukraine’s counteroffensive has succeeded in wresting back half the territory Russia captured earlier this year, breaching Russia’s vaunted “Surovikin line” of defence, weakening Russian logistics by striking deep into Crimea, and depriving Russia of control of the western Black Sea. Russia resumed an offensive effort towards the city of Kupiansk at the northeastern end of the front, on October 6, Ukraine’s eastern forces spokesman said. Russian sources confirmed the ground assault in the direction of Synkivka following an artillery barrage. Ukrainian officials said in July that Russia had launched a push to capture Kupiansk, and military analysts have assessed that this is a Russian effort to distract Ukrainian forces from parts of the front where they are achieving success. “If I was Russia today … I would do an immediate spoiling attack. I would go on the offensive somewhere,” Colonel Seth Krummrich, a vice president at Global Guardian, a security consultancy, told Al Jazeera in late June. “I would punch, because right now you’re running out of options …\\xa0 [the Ukrainians] are going to find a breach and they’re going to punch through it,” he said. That is what Russia did in Kupiansk the following month, but it didn’t stop Ukrainian forces from puncturing their first line of defence on the southern front, near Robotyne, in September. Russian forces near Robotyne appeared to have rotated troops of the 291st and 71st Motorized Rifle Regiments after gruelling September battles in which they retreated before a growing Ukrainian salient through their minefields and trenches. Russian forces near Robotyne and Verbove were busy re-mining front lines previously cleared by Ukrainian forces and slowing them down, said one Russian military blog calling itself Paratrooper’s Diary. “Although enemy armoured vehicles are increasingly appearing in the Robotyne-Verbove section, the enemy has reduced the movement time due to mined areas,” the blogger said. “Our sappers manage to re-mine areas already cleared by the enemy.” But the blog also corroborated Ukrainian reports that the counteroffensive was continuing. “The artillery does not stop for a minute,” the blogger said. Russian forces were going on the offensive elsewhere, too. As many as three Russian battalions attacked Ukrainian defences in October near Zherebyanky, west of Robotyne, claiming to have advanced 2km (1.2 miles). They launched a battalion-level offensive near Huliaipole on the southern front, advancing “several hundred metres”, according to one Russian reporter. And they stepped up efforts to capture Avdiivka, an eastern city they have surrounded to the north and south with a pincer movement. These tactical operations were aimed at freezing what has been a slow but steady Ukrainian advance ahead of Russian presidential elections, said Igor Girkin, a Russian military officer who organised the Russian militia that has fought the Ukrainian army since Donetsk and Luhansk declared they were seceding in 2014. “With a 99 percent probability, the Kremlin decided to freeze the war until the elections, that is, until March 2024,” wrote Girkin, who goes by the nom de guerre Strelkov, in a letter posted by his wife on social media. In his analysis, Russian President Vladimir Putin will do nothing to “seriously aggravate the social, economic and internal political situation in the country”, until spring, the sole priority being “to prevent deep breakthroughs or sensitive operational successes of the enemy”, until then. The Kremlin may expect a lull in winter fighting due to seasonal rainfall that will muddy the ground and make manoeuvres by tanks and armoured fighting vehicles difficult. But Ukraine has said it could maintain the momentum of its summer counteroffensive through the winter. “If the cold weather hits immediately … the ground will remain frozen and heavy machinery will be able to move on it,” said Ilya Yevlash, Ukraine’s eastern forces spokesman. Despite Russian spoiling attacks, Ukrainian forces pressed on with their counteroffensive. In their southern salient, they marginally advanced south of Robotyne on October 6 and broadened their salient westwards towards the village of Kopani on October 7. They also attempted to expand that salient east, towards Novofedorivka, on October 10. In the east, they continued to advance past the recently recaptured settlements of Klishchiivka and Andriivka south of Bakhmut, in an ongoing effort to surround the captured city and retake it. And on the Donetsk-Zaporizhia border, where the eastern and southern fronts meet, geolocated footage showed that they advanced near the village of Mykilske on October 10. Despite Slovakia’s September 30 election of a pro-Russia government, which has announced a halt to weapons deliveries to Ukraine, Slovakia joined fellow NATO members to accelerate training and munitions promised to Ukraine on October 9. NATO ministers voted to “further increase their military, intelligence, financial, training and humanitarian support to Ukraine”, including “long-range missiles and multi-purpose fighter aircraft, and to sustain this support for as long as it takes for Ukraine to prevail”.

       "  'Text': 'US package is the first to be announced since Congress dropped new funding for Kyiv to avoid a government shutdown. The United States will provide Ukraine with a new $200m military assistance package, including air defence and rocket ammunition. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced the package at the opening of a two-day meeting of Kyiv’s international supporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday. The package is the first since Congress dropped new funding for Kyiv from a bill to avoid a government shutdown earlier this month. The decision to drop the funding amid resistance from Republicans raised questions about Washington’s continued commitment to helping Ukraine fight against Russian forces. On Wednesday, Austin repeated assurances that the US will stand with Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. Absent further action by Congress, US President Joe Biden’s administration still has authority to withdraw more than $5bn worth of equipment from military stocks. However, the Department of Defense has only $1.6bn in remaining funding to replace donated weapons and equipment. Austin and Air Force General Charles Q Brown are also expected to use the meeting to reassure allies, including Kyiv, that it can maintain support for Ukraine while backing Israel in its conflict with Hamas. So far, the US has provided Ukraine with $44bn in military assistance since Russia’s invasion, including tanks, rockets and millions of rounds of ammunition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also attended the meeting in Brussels to press allies for more weapons before winter. “We are preparing, we are ready,” Zelenskyy said in advance of a meeting of defence ministers. “Now, we need some support from the leaders.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Russian President Vladimir Putin was “preparing once again to use winter as a weapon of war” by targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine. “We need to prevent that. With more advanced and increased capabilities for air defence, we can make a big difference,” Stoltenberg said. Ukraine has waged a counteroffensive to recapture territory in the south and east of the country since July, but has failed to make a breakthrough due to Russian fortifications and landmines. During the two-day gathering in Brussels, officials are also expected to discuss other security-related issues, including recent damage to an undersea gas pipeline and telecommunication cable linking Finland and Estonia.

       "  'Text': 'Russian leader blames explosion of violence on failed US Middle East policy that ignored aspirations of Palestinians. Russian President Vladimir Putin has voiced concern at the “catastrophic increase” in the number of civilians killed in Israel and the Gaza Strip amid days of fighting between Hamas and the Israeli military. The Russian leader also took aim on Tuesday at Washington’s policy in the Middle East, which he said had failed by not taking the needs of Palestinians into account. Putin, whose military has been accused of killing thousands of civilians since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, expressed his concern for civilians killed in Israel and Gaza during a phone call with Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Kremlin said in a statement. The “emphasis was placed on the sharply worsening situation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone”, the Kremlin said of the leaders’ discussion. “Deep concern was expressed about the continuing escalation of violence and the catastrophic increase in the number of civilian casualties,” the Kremlin said. The two leaders reiterated the need for “an immediate ceasefire” and for “the resumption of the negotiation process“, the Kremlin added, saying that Erdogan noted it was “regrettable to target civilian installations and that Turkey doesn’t welcome such acts”.      Earlier on Tuesday, Putin called the creation of a Palestinian state “necessary” and blamed the latest explosion of violence on US policy in the region. “I think that many people will agree with me that this is a vivid example of the failure of United States policy in the Middle East,” Putin said at the start of a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani on Tuesday. Putin said Washington had sought to “monopolise” efforts at forging peace between Israel and Palestinians, and he accused the US of not bothering to seek compromises acceptable to both sides but instead had pushed its own ideas for a solution to the conflict. The US had ignored the interests of Palestinians, including their need for their own independent state. 💬 President Putin: Unfortunately, we see a sharp escalation of the situation in the #MiddleEast. ☝️ This is an example of the US failed policy in the region.

Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin was in touch with both warring sides in Israel and Gaza and would seek to play a role in resolving the conflict. Peskov did not specify how that would be achieved. “We intend to keep making efforts and play our role in terms of providing assistance to seek ways to a settlement,” he said.      \\xa0 Since the latest crisis erupted, the Kremlin has sought to appear even-handed, underscoring its relations with both Israelis and Palestinians. Moscow has longstanding ties with the Palestinians, including Hamas, which sent a delegation to Moscow in March. But it also has “a lot in common” with Israel, including the fact that many Israelis are former Russian citizens, Peskov said. Peskov also warned that the current violence was “more than worrying”. “It has the potential to be dangerous by growing and spilling over from the current zone of the Arab-Israeli conflict,” he said. The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that it was ready to help reach a settlement between Israel and Palestinians by coordinating regional players. “We are in close contact with the leading regional players, whose role in stabilising the situation and creating conditions for establishing direct Palestinian-Israeli dialogue is indispensable,” ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, according to Russia’s state-run TASS news agency.

       "  'Text': 'Damage to undersea gas and telecommunications links comes just over a year after sabotage to Nord Stream gas pipeline. Damage to an undersea gas pipeline and telecommunications cable connecting Finland and Estonia appears to have been caused by “external activity”, Finnish and Estonian officials said. The Finnish government on Tuesday reported damage to a gas pipeline and a telecommunications cable with Estonia following an unusual drop in pressure on Sunday in the Balticconnector gas pipeline, which led to its shutdown. Speaking at a news conference, Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo stopped short of calling the pipeline damage an act of sabotage but said it could not have been caused by regular operations. “According to a preliminary assessment, the observed damage could not have occurred as a result of normal use of the pipe or pressure fluctuations. It is likely that the damage is the result of external activity,” Orpo said. Finnish and Estonian authorities are working closely together to investigate the damage to 🇫🇮🇪🇪 undersea infrastructure. Finland is well prepared, our readiness is high and the situation is stable. Our security of supply is not threatened. #BalticConnector — Petteri Orpo (@PetteriOrpo) October 10, 2023  Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation was leading an inquiry into the leak, Orpo said. Finnish telecoms operator Elisa also confirmed on Tuesday that it suffered a break in a data cable connecting Finland and Estonia over the weekend. Asked by a reporter whether Finland’s government suspected Russian involvement in the latest incident, Orpo said he did not want to speculate on potential perpetrators before authorities completed the investigation in Finland. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that Estonia and Finland had informed their allies in NATO and the European Union regarding the incidents and she was in contact with the Finnish leader on the “next steps” to be taken. “Both Estonia and Finland are taking these incidents very seriously and are doing everything possible to determine the circumstances,” Kallas said in a statement. I convened ministers and relevant authorities to discuss incidents regarding #Balticconnector and an undersea communication cable. While there’s no threat to our security of supply, both Estonia and Finland are taking the incidents very seriously. 🔗 https://t.co/SkPNc4IAr0 — Kaja Kallas (@kajakallas) October 10, 2023  The damaged cable and pipeline “are in very different locations, although the timing [of the incidents] is quite close”, Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur told a press briefing. Pevkur said that Estonian authorities received photos confirming that the damage to the Balticconnector was “mechanical” and “human-made”. “This damage must have been caused by some force that was not created by … a diver or a small underwater robot; the damage is more massive,” Pevkur said, adding that seismologists have previously stated there was no explosion at the incident site. Heidi Soosalu, a seismologist at the Estonian Geological Service, told the Estonian public broadcaster ERR on Tuesday that neither Estonian nor Finnish seismic stations registered anything resembling explosions during the time period the Balticconnector registered a loss of pressure. The incident comes just over a year after the Nord Stream gas pipelines running between Germany and Russia in the Baltic Sea were damaged by explosions believed to be sabotage. That case remains unsolved.      Estonia’s Navy told The Associated Press news agency they were conducting an investigation on the damaged gas pipeline together with the Finnish military in the Gulf of Finland. The 77km-long (48 miles) Balticconnector pipeline runs across the Gulf of Finland from the Finnish city of Inkoo to the Estonian port of Paldiski. The 300 million euro ($318m) pipeline, largely financed by the EU, started commercial operations at the beginning of 2020. The Balticconnector has been the only gas import channel to Finland, apart from LNG, since Russian imports were halted in May 2022, following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.      \\xa0 Russia stopped supplying gas to Finland after it refused to pay Moscow in rubles, a condition imposed on “unfriendly countries” – including EU member states – as a way to sidestep Western financial sanctions against Russia’s central bank. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she had spoken with Finnish premier Orpo and Estonia’s Kallas regarding damage to the gas pipeline and telecoms cable. “Only by working together can we counter those seeking to undermine our security, and ensure that our critical infrastructure remains robust and reliable in the face of evolving threats,” von der Leyen said in a statement. I held calls with Prime Ministers @kajakallas and @PetteriOrpo on the on-going investigations into the damage on the gas pipeline and data cable connecting Estonia and Finland.

       "  'Text': 'Historic ties between Kyiv and Tel Aviv appear stronger than recent disagreements over weapons deliveries as Ukrainians express support for Israel. Kyiv, Ukraine – To Valentina Boyko, what’s happening in Ukraine and Israel is strikingly similar. “We were attacked. They were attacked. Both attacks were stealthy, backstabbing,” the Kyiv resident told Al Jazeera, referring to Russia’s invasion of her homeland and the Hamas-Israeli war that began on Saturday. Just metres away from her, lying on one of the concrete slabs that surround the Israeli embassy in Kyiv, were fresh flowers and pieces of paper reading “Praying for Israel” in English and Ukrainian. Boyko’s opinion is shared by many in Ukraine, despite Tel Aviv’s refusal to provide air defence systems to Kyiv and sanction Moscow, as well as Israel’s steps to temporarily suspend visa-free travel for Ukrainians and restrict the arrival of refugees. Historic ties seem stronger than current disagreements – a mere century ago, what is now Ukraine was home to one of the largest diasporas of Ashkenazi Jews and the birthplace of Hasidism, a reformist doctrine in Judaism. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who won Ukraine’s presidency in 2019 by the largest landslide in the country’s history, and some of his cabinet members are proud of their Jewish roots. “I have Jewish blood. And I’m president. And nobody cares, right?” Zelenskyy told The Times of Israel in 2020. The fact and the phrase would seem impossible to Nikolai Gogol, Ukraine’s most celebrated author, who described how Cossacks killed Jews with habitual, thoughtless cruelty. However, Zelenskyy’s heritage does not guarantee an overwhelming approval by Israelis of everything he says and does. His March 2022 address to Israeli lawmakers was lambasted for his comparison of the Russian-Ukrainian war with the Holocaust and his scathing criticism of Israeli-Russian ties. However, as the war with Russia approaches its 600th day and the annexation of Crimea nears its 10th anniversary, many Ukrainians see Israel as a nation that thrives despite a decades-long conflict – and one that has advanced weaponry and intelligence services that minimise risks for civilians. The idea proved outdated on Saturday, when Hamas unleashed surprise attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip, killing and kidnapping hundreds – and catching Israeli intelligence and military off guard. “Hamas de-sacralised the myth about the Israeli defence sector. Turns out that Israel wasn’t ready for the invasion neither technically nor technologically,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. He sees similarities between Hamas leaders and those in the Kremlin, who can mobilise their subjects against their neighbours. “In the 21st century, a consumer and information society is not ready for a total war. That’s an axiom. But poor and ideologised societies are ready for it,” he said. The Hamas-Israeli war may also convince Ukrainians to seek membership in NATO even more doggedly.      \\xa0 “Recent events will somehow tarnish Israel’s image from the viewpoint of maintaining their security and will prompt more critical attitude to all formats of US security ‘guarantees’ beyond NATO,” Kyiv-based expert Vyacheslav Likhachev told Al Jazeera. Before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv and Tel Aviv had a “good level of mutual understanding,” he said. But last year’s return to power of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long boasted of his “special” ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, galvanised the dissatisfaction. “The Ukrainian public, with its sensitivity sharpened by the collective trauma, also began to somewhat childishly get vexed with Israel,” Likhachev said. Some 43 percent of Ukrainians were opposed to Tel Aviv’s refusal to supply arms, but a third still “understands and accepts” the decision, according to a January poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. Some 52 percent of Ukrainians still consider Israel a “friendly nation,” and only 12.5 percent disagree, the poll said. “The current public opinion about Israel is truly strategically balanced because potentially (and in some practical aspects – right now) Israel is Ukraine’s important partner,” the poll’s organisers concluded. And even Ukrainian far-right groups and their lionisation of figures who contributed to the Holocaust do not affect the attitude. In Ukrainian-Israeli ties, every year used to begin with an almost ritual diplomatic spat. Before the full-scale Russian invasion, thousands used to march with torchlights on January 1, the birthday of Stepan Bandera, a Ukrainian nationalist who briefly sided with Nazi Germany to fight with Communist Moscow during World War II. And even though Bandera was thrown in a German concentration camp after a falling out with the Nazis, and was poisoned in Munich in 1959 by a Soviet assassin, Israel lambasts him and his supporters for their role in the mass killings of Ukrainian Jews. So, hours after the marching nationalists would stop chanting “Bandera is our father, Ukraine is our mother” on the streets of Kyiv, the Israeli embassy would issue a protest denouncing the march. But despite their penchant for carefully staged street rallies, Ukrainian far-right groups have little political clout, which has diminished even further during the war. And another annual event would prove how dismal and insignificant anti-Semitism in Ukraine has become. Every October, tens of thousands of Hasidic Jews flock to the grave of Rabbi Nachman, who founded the Breslov branch of Hasidism and asked his followers to visit his grave in the central Ukrainian city of Uman. Even though Russian cruise missiles reached Uman several times, killing two dozen people, more than 32,000 pilgrims still thronged the streets near Nachman’s grave in mid-September. “Nothing can stop them, their faith and determination are too strong,” Uman resident Alex Melnik, whose family has for years rented their apartment to pilgrims, told Al Jazeera. And as reports from Israel and the Gaza Strip dominate news broadcasts and front pages, some Ukrainians have very simplistic explanations for who and what is behind the conflict. “Russia helped Hamas start this war because Putin wants to distract the world from our war,” Roman Zhelyabenko, who fled his Russia-occupied city of Berdyansk in southeastern Ukraine for Kyiv last year, told Al Jazeera.

The air force did not say which targets, if any, the nine other drones may have hit. The governor of Mykolaiv, Vitaliy Kim, said on Telegram that one of the drones had been destroyed over his region. There was no immediate comment from Russia. Separately, Kherson region’s administration said on its Telegram channel that four people had been injured and several buildings damaged in 79 instances of shelling using mortars, artillery and drones. Russia has stepped up attacks on ports in southern Ukraine since exiting a deal that allowed safe passage for grain shipments through the Black Sea in July. Kyiv has also warned that Moscow is restarting a campaign of aerial attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, mirroring attacks that last year left millions without heating and water for long periods. In September, Moscow launched more than 500 Shahed drones – a monthly record, according to Ukrainian consultancy group Defense Express. Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after annexing the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Ukrainian president says Moscow and the Palestinian armed group that attacked Israel are ‘terrorists’, while alleging Iran has a role in both conflicts. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has linked the recent assault by Hamas on Israel with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and criticised Iran over both conflicts. On Monday, he likened the Palestinian armed group to Russia, saying it was a “terrorist organisation” while Russia can be considered a “terrorist state”. Zelenskyy told NATO’s Parliamentary Assembly in Copenhagen via video link: “The only difference is that there is a terrorist organisation that attacked Israel and here is a terrorist state that attacked Ukraine. The intentions declared are different, but the essence is the same.” Ukraine said about 1,000 Iranian-designed Shahed drones were used by Russia over the past six months. “Iran can’t say it has nothing to do with what is going on in Ukraine if it sells Shaheds to Russia. Iran can’t say it has nothing to do with what is going on in Israel if its officials claim the support of what is going on in Israel,” Zelenskyy said. Israel was caught off guard on Saturday when Hamas launched an attack, blowing up parts of the country’s highly fortified separation fence, and sending fighters into Israeli communities along the Gaza frontier. The surprise assault set off a major war between Israel and the armed group, which has so far killed more than 1,100 people. The conflict continues to escalate, with Israel on Monday declaring that it will impose a “total blockade” on Gaza, the besieged, densely populated Palestinian strip often described as an “open-air prison”, where 120,000 people have already been displaced due to the latest tensions. Palestinian fears of an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza are growing. Iran has denied it has supplied Russia with Shahed kamikaze drones for use in Ukraine and has said it is not involved in the weekend’s attacks on Israel. An Israeli army spokesperson said on Saturday that “Iran’s tentacles” were “everywhere” when asked about a possible role. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there was no evidence Iran was behind the attacks on Israel, but he said there were longstanding ties between Tehran and Hamas. Iran has voiced support for Hamas after its attack, but slammed the allegations of involvement in Hamas’s operation as politically motivated. Rahim Safavi, an adviser to Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei, was quoted by the semi-official ISNA news site, saying: “We congratulate the Palestinian fighters … We will stand by the Palestinian fighters until the liberation of Palestine and Jerusalem.” Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said attacks by Hamas were proof of the Palestinians’ increased confidence in the face of Israel’s occupation. Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Tehran, said Iran’s solidarity with Hamas is historical. “Iran, since the revolution of 1979, has really seen itself as a Shia minority in the Middle East – it’s [one of few] Shia majority [countries in the region]. “There were a number of steps taken by the founder of the revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini, to ensure that Iran’s position remained secure. “One was to align with resistance groups, not just Shia groups like Hezbollah, but also like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, to ensure their own existence down the line. “Israel has always been a point of contention for Iran. They don’t believe Israel has a right to exist as a country. They say Palestine is a country that has been oppressed.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

The ministry issued two near-identical Telegram posts on Saturday night saying that Kyiv had “attempted a terrorist attack” at 6pm (15:00 GMT) and 10pm (19:00GMT) Moscow time with an S-200 anti-aircraft missile that had been “converted to an attack version”. Another Ukrainian drone was also shot down near Moscow early on Saturday, the Russian TASS news agency reported, adding that it appeared to cause no damage or injuries. In Russia’s Belgorod, local authorities said three Ukrainian Tochka-U missiles were destroyed over the border region and that shelling by Kyiv’s forces had killed one person who was on the street at the time of the attack. In Ukraine, a member of Russia’s governing United Russia Party was killed by a car bomb in the Russian-held town of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region, according to officials. Vladimir Malov died in hospital, the officials said. In the Ukrainian town of Hroza in the Kharkiv region, local residents began burying victims of a Russian missile strike that killed some 50 people on Friday. Representatives from the United Nations Monitoring Mission in Ukraine told The Associated Press news agency that conversations with local residents and survivors indicate “that virtually all those killed were civilians and that the target itself, a busy village cafe and store, was also clearly civilian”. Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia’s Chechnya region and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, proposed that a presidential election due next March should either be postponed due to the war in Ukraine or limited to one candidate. “I propose now, while the ‘special military operation’ is under way, to unanimously decide that we will have one candidate in the elections – Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin,” Kadyrov was quoted as saying. “Or temporarily call off the elections, because there’s no one else who could defend our country today.” A United States think tank said rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border spiked this week to the highest in years, suggesting arms supplies by Pyongyang to Moscow after the leaders of the two countries discussed deeper military cooperation. The Center for Strategic and International Studies said satellite imagery showed an “unprecedented” 73 or so freight cars at Tumangang Rail Station in the North Korean border city of Rason. The traffic was far greater than that observed in the past five years, including pre-pandemic levels, it said. Denmark’s defence ministry said it aims to restart ammunition production after a 55-year gap to ensure its domestic supplies as Russia’s war in Ukraine creates increased demand for military hardware across Europe.

       "  'Text': 'Russia says withdrawal from ratification of nuclear weapons test ban treaty places Moscow on ‘equal footing’ with US, which has not ratified the pact. The United States said it was “disturbed” by a Russian envoy’s announcement that Moscow will reverse its ratification of a 1996 treaty that banned the testing of nuclear weapons. Russia’s envoy to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization\\xa0(CTBTO), Mikhail Ulyanov, said on Friday that Moscow will revoke its ratification of the pact. The announcement by Ulyanov added new fuel to tensions between the world’s largest nuclear weapons powers amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and US military support for Kyiv. Ulyanov said on social media that “Russia plans to revoke ratification [which took place in the year 2000] of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty [CTBT]”. “The aim is to be on equal footing with the US who signed the treaty, but didn’t ratify it. Revocation doesn’t mean the intention to resume nuclear tests,” he said. #Russia plans to revoke ratification (which took place in the year 2000) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (#CTBT). The aim is to be on equal footing with the #US who signed the Treaty, but didn’t ratify it. Revocation doesn’t mean the intention to resume nuclear tests — Mikhail Ulyanov (@Amb_Ulyanov) October 6, 2023  \\xa0 Though Washington signed but has not ratified the CTBT, it has observed a moratorium on nuclear weapons test explosions since 1992. Responding to Russia’s announcement, the US State Department said it was “disturbed” by the move. “We are disturbed by the comments of Ambassador Ulyanov in Vienna today,” a US State Department spokesperson said in a statement. “A move like this by any state party needlessly endangers the global norm against nuclear explosive testing,” the State Department said. Russia should not be “wielding arms control and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric in a failing attempt to coerce other states”, the State Department added, appearing to suggest that Moscow’s plan to withdraw from the ratification of the treaty was aimed at pressuring the US and other countries who are supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian forces.      Ulyanov’s statement followed a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow could reassess its ratification of the treaty. Speaking on Thursday at a forum with foreign affairs experts, Putin noted that the US had signed but not ratified the 1996 nuclear test ban treaty, while Russia had signed and also ratified. Russia might adjust its stance to mirror that of the US, Putin said. “Theoretically, we may revoke the ratification,” he said. “It’s up to the state duma members.” Putin also said that while some have discussed the need for Russia to conduct nuclear tests, he had not yet formed an opinion on the subject. “I’m not ready to say yet whether it’s necessary for us to conduct tests or not,” he said.      Asked if Russia’s rescinding of the ban would pave the way for the resumption of nuclear bomb tests, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “it doesn’t mean a statement about the intention to resume nuclear tests”. Revoking Russia’s ratification of the ban would “bring the situation to a common denominator” with the US, Peskov said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged “all nuclear weapon states to publicly reaffirm their moratoriums against nuclear testing and their commitment to the CTBT”, UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said on Friday. Robert Floyd, the executive director of the CTBTO, which monitors compliance with the pact, said in a statement that it would “be concerning and deeply unfortunate if any State Signatory were to reconsider its ratification of the CTBT”. I am aware of recent media reports about the possibility of the Russian Federation revoking its  ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). See my full statement on this important matter here: ➡️ https://t.co/7MtghrrE3x — Robert Floyd (@_RobFloyd) October 6, 2023  “The Russian Federation has consistently reaffirmed its strong support of the CTBT since its very inception, helping to negotiate the Treaty in the Conference on Disarmament, signing the day it opened for signature on 24 September 1996, and ratifying it in June 2000,” Floyd said. “The CTBT has established a powerful norm against nuclear testing and is making an invaluable contribution to international peace and security, for the good of humanity. It is more important than ever that we reinforce that contribution,” he added.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '6 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Russia relocates ships from their main base in Sevastopol while the UK lauds Kyiv’s ‘functional defeat of the Black Sea Fleet’. Kyiv, Ukraine – “Russian warship, go f*** yourself!” is the phrase dating back to the first days of the Russia-Ukrainian war, that spawned countless memes and bumper stickers. It is what Ukrainian servicemen stationed on the Zmiiny Island, or Snake Island, in the Black Sea replied to the Russian warship’s urge to surrender. But by early 2022, the Russian Black Sea Fleet based in annexed Crimea, seemed to have gained absolute control over Ukraine’s territorial waters in the Black Sea and its smaller, shallower sibling, the Sea of Azov. Its larger ships shelled Ukraine’s main seaport, Odesa, and other southern cities with missiles and drones, killing civilians and destroying apartment buildings, military installations and port infrastructure. Smaller Russian navy vessels stopped and officiously inspected merchant ships carrying grain and sunflower oil, Ukraine’s key exports. Russian navy felt at ease in all of the Black Sea’s northern part – but after almost 600 days of war, the tables have turned. “They miscalculated,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, the former deputy chief of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces, told Al Jazeera. “We won’t let them rest and won’t rest ourselves until we fully de-occupy our lands.” Satellite imagery shows that at least a dozen Russian vessels, including guided missile frigates, landing ships and submarines, have been hastily relocated from their main base in Sevastopol, a subtropical port in annexed Crimea. Most were moved to the Russian port of Novorossiisk more than 300km (186 miles) east of Sevastopol, or on other, smaller bases or bays in eastern Crimea or along Russia’s Black Sea coast. British Defence Minister James Heappey compared the “functional defeat of the Black Sea Fleet” to the liberation of Kharkiv Oblast one year ago. “The fleet has been forced to disperse to ports from which it cannot have an effect on Ukraine,” he said on Tuesday. The relocation follows a series of daring Ukrainian attacks with Western-supplied cruise missiles and domestically assembled aerial and naval drones that destroyed flagships, smaller cutters and even a docked submarine. They also annihilated two advanced S-400 air defence systems creating sizeable “holes” in the sky over Crimea. And, most importantly, they damaged a major shipyard with a dry dock that was essential for repairing decades-old Russian ships. “What was critical for Russia wasn’t damage to vessels, it was damage to the shipyard,” Kyiv-based analyst Ihar Tyshkevich told Al Jazeera. “This is the reason why a large part of the Black Sea fleet vessels were relocated to Novorossiisk.” On September 22, Kyiv barraged and partially destroyed the Fleet’s headquarters in a snow-white Stalinist building in Sevastopol. The attacks dramatically reduced Russia’s capabilities to land troops near Odesa and back occupying forces in the southern region of Kherson, analysts have said. “Ukraine’s actions have wrestled control of Ukraine’s western territorial waters back from Russia and prevented the Black Sea Fleet from threatening Odesa with amphibious assault or providing tactical fires and logistical support to Russian forces in Kherson,” retired US Army Major General Gordon Skip Davis Jr told Al Jazeera. The success seems even more staggering given that Ukraine’s minuscule navy lost most of its ships during Crimea’s 2014 annexation and consists of two dozen obsolete vessels that can all fit into a tiny bay. The possibility of future sea drone attacks deterred Russian ships that inspected vessels with Ukrainian grain. Russian ships “can defend themselves with a relative effect only if there’s a group of vessels”, while inspections make logistical sense only if carried out by individual ships, analyst Tyshkevich said. However, these days, Ukrainian and international shipping companies prefer to use smaller vessels that can move along the Black Sea coast towards Romanian ports on the Danube, a gateway to Eastern and Central Europe. But “the Danube ports are not deep, a Panamax ship [with a tonnage of more than 50,000] won’t enter them, and the cargo needs to be reloaded either at sea or in other ports,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. Therefore, the overall capacity of the Odesa port fell tenfold, and only about 20 vessels carrying about 100,000 tonnes of wheat leave it every month, he said. The irony is that the entire Black Sea fleet could have been Ukrainian if it was not for the pacifism of its early leaders – and Ukraine’s dire economic situation in the 1990s. Founded in Sevastopol in 1783, the fleet won naval battles with Ottoman Turkey, fought Nazi Germans and often confronted NATO in the Mediterranean. Ukraine proclaimed independence on August 24, 1991, and just days later, Moscow appointed Admiral Igor Kasatonov as head of the gargantuan fleet that employed some 100,000 servicemen and 60,000 auxiliary staffers serving 833 warships and hundreds of aircraft. It had bases in what is now Russia, Moldova and Georgia, and Soviet naval outposts in Syria and Libya reported to it. Kasatonov arrived in Kyiv in early 1992 to meet Ukraine’s first post-Soviet President Leonid Kravchuk and pledge allegiance to Kyiv, a witness said. But the meeting did not go well, and he ran out of it “absolutely crazy”, photographer Efrem Lukatsky told Al Jazeera. “He began to spill his guts to me, and said that [Kravchuk], as it turns out, didn’t need the Fleet,” he said. The decision seemed logical at the time as Ukraine simply could not afford to maintain the fleet, and Kasatonov pledged allegiance to Russia on January 4, 1992. Moscow and Kyiv decided to run the fleet jointly as idle ships rusted away and were often sold for scrap metal. Rumours had it that even Colombian drug cartels could buy a small submarine for smuggling cocaine. Only in 1997, Moscow and Kyiv partitioned the fleet – very unevenly. Kyiv got 30 warships and cutters, one submarine, 34 auxiliary ships and 90 aircraft. Moscow got 338 warships, 106 planes and helicopters and agreed to lease several bases in and around Sevastopol and several other locations in Crimea. The lease cost Russia almost $100m annually, and the fleet remained the largest employer in Sevastopol. Since the 1944 Stalinist deportation of several Crimean communities – Tatars, Greeks, Armenians and Bulgarians – Moscow moved hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians to the peninsula. They largely remained loyal to Moscow and stubbornly resisted Kyiv’s attempts to promote Ukrainian as the language of administration and education. Politically, they were close to the Russian “red belt” regions that supported Communists. “Ukrainian Crimea mentally was a total part of it,” Sergey Biziykin, a fugitive Russian opposition activist who visited Crimea in the early 2000s, told Al Jazeera. Kremlin-controlled media widely available in Crimea transformed its residents’ pro-Communist sympathies into loyalty to Russia in general as cash-strapped Kyiv did not invest in the peninsula’s decaying infrastructure. “They ignore us, they see us as a place for cheap vacations,” Valentina Minina, a pro-Moscow protester in Sevastopol holding a Russian flag, told this reporter just days before the March 16, 2014 “referendum” that heralded Crimea’s annexation. “We want to be with Russia because it respects us, it will make things right here.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Relatives struggling to cope after attack that killed more than 50 people in tiny village in northeastern Ukraine. The missile attack was sudden and devastating. In an instant, more than 50 people – or one-sixth of the population of Hroza, a remote village in Ukraine’s northeast – were wiped out. Among those killed on Thursday in one of the deadliest attacks since Russia invaded Ukraine some 20 months ago was Olya, 36, who is survived by three children. Her husband died, too. “It would have been better if I had died,” Olya’s father, Valeriy Kozyr said at the local cemetery as he prepared to bury her and his son-in-law. “Oh God, you cannot punish me like this. To leave the father and take the children!” he told the Reuters news agency as he wept. Wiping tears from his face, the 61-year-old explained that he must now work out how to care for his three grandchildren aged 10, 15 and 17.      He said he was not in the cafe at the time of the attack because he worked night shifts as a security guard, and so was spared. “Half the village is gone, families are gone,” said Kozyr, standing beside his wife as she wept. “All the time they miss. Well, this time, they hit. Now I’ll have to cross out half my phone book.” Nearby, three brothers were readying a plot in which to bury their parents, both killed in what President Volodymr Zelenskyy has called a “deliberate” Russian assault on civilians.  Ukrainian officials say early findings suggest that Russia used an Iskander missile in the attack on the village of about 330 people. “From every family, from every household, there were people present at this commemoration,” Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko told Ukrainian television. “This is a terrible tragedy.” On Friday, the UN human rights office spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell also said that “given the location, given the fact that the cafe was struck, the indications are that it was a Russian missile.” But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday denied that Russia was responsible for the attack in Hroza and repeated that the Russian military does not target civilian facilities.      Reporting on Friday from the site of the attack, Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi said Hroza’s tiny community “has been absolutely devastated” by the attack. “You can still smell the blood in the air, the blood that was soaked up by the ground from the bodies that were strewn all over,” he said. “The building that was hit is unrecognisable, completely gone. There is just rubble,” Basravi added, standing next to a massive mound of broken concrete blocks, twisted metal and shattered glass. “There are clothes, children’s toys … patches of blood where bodies were pulled out and were laying here.” Not all of the victims have been identified. Regional police investigator Serhiy Bolvinov told reporters late on Thursday that authorities would have to use DNA to identify some of the victims, because their remains were beyond recognition. “Corpses lay there in that yard, and nobody could identify them,” said Valentyna Kozienko, 73, speaking near her home close to the site. As darkness fell on Thursday, dazed emergency crews carried bodies placed in white bags onto the back of a pick-up truck. A local man knelt dnd wept as he lay his hand on the remains of a loved one before they too, were taken away. Resident Oleksandr Mukhovatyi said he lost his mother, brother and sister-in-law. “Someone betrayed us. The attack was precise, it all landed in the coffee shop.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Putin’s prediction comes as concerns mount about future of US funding for Ukraine amid political turmoil in Washington. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Ukraine could not survive for more than “a week” without Western military and financial aid, a claim made on the same day as a European Union official warned that the bloc could not replace the funding gap if support for Kyiv from the United States dried up. Putin made his remarks on Western funding for Ukraine as fears mount that political turmoil in Washington could jeopardise crucial military and humanitarian aid that Kyiv requires to battle Russia’s invasion. US President Joe Biden admitted this week that he “does worry” US support for Ukraine might get derailed. Speaking on Thursday at a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, a Moscow-based think tank, in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin said that Ukraine was being propped up “thanks to multi-billion donations that come each month”. “If one just stops, it will all die in a week,” Putin said. “The same applies to the defence system. Just imagine the aid stops tomorrow. It will live for only a week when they run out of ammo,” he said. Putin also claimed that Ukraine had lost more than 90,000 troops since Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian forces began in June.      At a meeting of the European Political Community (EPC) in Spain on Thursday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the EU could not replace the US as Kyiv’s primary donor. “Can Europe fill the gap left by the US? Well, certainly Europe cannot replace the US,” Borrell said. The EU and the US – together comprising most NATO members – are vital in Ukraine’s fight against Russia. The EU and its member states have promised more than $100bn in multi-year support to Ukraine, including financing weapon deliveries. Washington has committed $43bn in military assistance, while Congress has approved $113bn, which includes humanitarian aid. But new US funding for Ukraine has been put on hold as part of a weekend deal struck with opposition Republicans to avert a US government shutdown. The removal by hardline Republicans of their own House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy this week has added to the uncertainty around aid for Ukraine. Some of the hardliners want US aid to Ukraine to cease.      Jim Dubik, a senior fellow at the Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank, said that Putin is counting on NATO and the US to wane in their support for Ukraine, and recent events in the US Congress play into Putin’s hands. “By cutting aid to Ukraine, Congress is directly supporting Putin’s desire to divide the alliance … Congress’s recent action does not manifest the strategic leadership the world expects of the United States,” Dubik said in a comment posted on social media. \"#Putin isn’t going to quit unless he’s forced to. Given the poor state of #Russian forces, he’s barely been hanging on and is counting on US and #NATO support to wane. By cutting aid to #Ukraine, Congress is directly supporting Putin’s desire to divide the alliance.\" 2/4 — ISW (@TheStudyofWar) October 4, 2023  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking to the meeting in Spain of European leaders on Thursday, expressed concern about Washington’s “political storms” but said he was confident he still had US bipartisan backing. Leaders at the EPC summit said Putin’s calculation was that the West would become fatigued at long-term support of Ukraine, handing him a path to victory. “I think Russia wants us to be tired,” Estonia’s Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said, adding: “We should show them that we are not. We have to help Ukraine as long as it takes.”. French President Emmanuel Macron reinforced that message in a meeting with Zelenskyy, pledging “tireless” support for Ukraine. But within the EU there are fissures. Slovakia announced it has frozen decisions on military aid to neighbouring Ukraine following parliamentary elections on Sunday which were won by\\xa0former Prime Minister Robert Fico’s SMER-SSD party, which campaigned on a promise to end military support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia.

       "  'Text': 'Russian leader says grenade fragments were found in the bodies of those killed in the jet crash in which Wagner’s Yevgeny Prigozhin died. Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested that the plane crash which killed the head of the Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was caused by the detonation of hand grenades inside the aircraft. Putin suggested on Thursday that Prigozhin’s plane was blown up from the inside, not hit by a missile as rumoured, saying that the head of Russia’s investigative committee had reported that traces of explosives were discovered in the bodies of those who died in the crash in August. “Fragments of hand grenades were found in the bodies of those killed in the crash,” Putin told a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. “There was no external impact on the plane – this is already an established fact,” Putin said, appearing to rubbish claims by United States officials who believed the plane was shot down. The private Embraer jet on which Prigozhin was travelling to Saint Petersburg crashed north of Moscow killing all 10 people on board on August 23. Two other top Wagner figures, Prigozhin’s four bodyguards and a crew of three were also killed. Putin did not give any more details about how a grenade or grenades could have been detonated on board the executive jet, but said he thought investigators were wrong not to have carried out alcohol and drug tests on the bodies of those who died in the crash. “In my opinion, such an examination should have been carried out, but it was not,” Putin said.      Putin also claimed that searches of Wagner’s offices in St Petersburg after the crash turned up 10 billion roubles ($100m) in cash and 5kg (11 pounds) of cocaine. The investigators of the crash have yet to report publicly on their findings. Moscow rejected an offer from Brazil, where the Embraer business jet was built, to join the crash inquiry. The Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank monitoring the conflict in Ukraine, described Putin’s explanation for the crash as “bizarre” and intended to “deflect blame from the Kremlin”. The ISW said that Putin appeared to be sketching a scenario involving alcohol, drugs and the mishandling of explosives by people on board the plane in an attempt to blame the victims for their own deaths. The Russian president “implied that the plane crash victims may have been using alcohol or drugs onboard that could have led to the negligent handling of grenades (that were presumably on board for some unexplained reason)”, the think tank said. “Putin’s bizarre explanation of the plane crash is likely an attempt to blame Prigozhin for his own and his comrades’ deaths and further disgrace him among his remaining supporters,” the ISW added. #Putin offered a bizarre explanation for #Wagner Group financier Yevgeny #Prigozhin’s death during a press conference at the Valdai Discussion Club on October 5 to deflect blame from the #Kremlin. https://t.co/go1WolGnbG https://t.co/aIKTcDWBTv pic.twitter.com/P43L2G1QI6 — ISW (@TheStudyofWar) October 6, 2023  Prigozhin died in the crash exactly two months to the day after leading a short-lived mutiny against Russia’s defence establishment and presented the biggest challenge to Putin’s rule since he came to power in 1999. A preliminary US intelligence assessment concluded that an intentional explosion caused the crash, and Western officials have pointed to a long list of Putin foes who have been assassinated. The Kremlin has rejected as an “absolute lie” the suggestion that Putin had Prigozhin killed in revenge for the rebellion by the Wagner private army. The fate of Wagner has been unclear since Prigozhin’s death.      Putin has ordered Wagner fighters to sign contracts with Russia’s defence ministry, a move which Prigozhin and many of his men had opposed. When asked about the future of so-called private military companies in Russia, Putin said on Thursday that as there had been no law on such groups, the experience of them in Russia had been “clumsy”. “We do not yet have a consensus in Russia about whether we need such formations or not, but today I can say for sure that several thousand fighters of this company have already signed contracts with the armed forces,” Putin said. Before his death, Prigozhin had accused Russia’s military leaders, \\xa0particularly Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov, of incompetence and warned that Russia could lose the war in Ukraine unless it raised its game. After his death, Putin described the Wagner chief as a man who had made “serious mistakes in his life but he achieved the right results”. The Wagner Group mercenary force that Prigozhin created was active in Ukraine, Syria, Libya and several African countries and counted tens of thousands of fighters at its peak.      Sanctioned by the European Union and the US for gross human rights abuses in the countries where Wagner deployed, the force played a key role in the fighting in Ukraine, where it spearheaded the capture of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut in May after months of bloody combat.

       "  'Date': '5 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The Russian leader said that his country could ‘theoretically’ withdraw from landmark nuclear test ban treaty. Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested that Russia could return to nuclear weapons testing and might withdraw its ratification of a landmark nuclear test ban treaty. In an address on Thursday that touched on topics such as nuclear weapons, energy, and the war in Ukraine, Putin also said that Russia had tested a new nuclear-powered missile delivery system but had not decided whether to resume the testing of explosives. “I think no person of sound mind and clear memory would think of using nuclear weapons against Russia,” Putin said in the speech at a forum of foreign policy experts in Sochi. “I hear calls to start testing nuclear weapons, to return to testing,” he added. “I am not ready to say whether we really need to conduct tests or not.” He announced that Russia has effectively completed the development of the Burevestnik cruise missile and the Sarmat heavy intercontinental ballistic missile and will work on putting them into production. “We conducted the last successful test of the Burevestnik nuclear-powered global-range cruise missile,” he said. His statement was the first announcement of a successful test of the Burevestnik, which translates as “Storm Petrel.” It was first mentioned by Putin in 2018. Little is known about the Burevestnik, which was code-named Skyfall by NATO, and many Western experts have been sceptical about it, noting that a nuclear engine could be highly unreliable. It is believed to be able to carry a nuclear warhead or a conventional one, and potentially could stay aloft for a much longer time than other missiles and cover much more distance, due to nuclear propulsion.      Putin’s speech is the latest in which the Russian leader underscored the country’s nuclear capabilities, as relations between Russia and Western powers remain tense over Russia’s war in Ukraine. Putin said that it was “theoretically” possible for Russia to withdraw from the nuclear test ban treaty, which generally prohibits the testing of nuclear weapons, but that no decision has been made. He also noted that the United States has not signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, stating that Russia, which ratified the agreement in 2000, may follow in its steps. In the wide-ranging speech, the Russian president said that the West was trying to create “a new Iron Curtain” and laid responsibility for the Russian invasion of Ukraine at the feet of Western powers. “The war, which was started by the Kyiv regime with active support from the West, has been going on already for 10 years,” he said. “The special military operation was launched to stop it.” Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Since then, thousands of civilians have been killed and millions of others have fled the country, according to the United Nations. Tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed or wounded on each side and large swathes of eastern and southern Ukraine have been devastated in the fighting. Earlier on Thursday, Ukrainian officials reported that a Russian missile strike had slammed into a grocery store and cafe near the city of Kharkiv, killing at least 51 people. In his speech, Putin also said that Russia was attempting to create a “new world” in defiance of Western “hegemony”, praising the rising influence of Eastern countries such as India and China. He also reiterated Russia’s opposition to Ukraine’s accession to NATO, which he deemed a tool of US foreign policy, but said that he has no objections to Ukraine joining the European Union.

       "  'Text': 'Ukrainian officials say a six-year-old boy among those killed in attack on Hroza village, where residents were attending a wake. At least 51 people have been killed and six wounded in a Russian missile attack on a northeastern village, Ukrainian officials say. Oleh Syniehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the afternoon strike on Thursday hit a cafe and a store in the village of Hroza, about 30km (20 miles) west of the front-line town of Kupiansk, with many civilians present at the time of the attack. He added that a six-year-old child was among the dead. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said residents of the village of about 330 people had been holding a memorial service in the cafe that was struck. “From every family, from every household, there were people present at this commemoration. This is a terrible tragedy,” Klymenko told Ukrainian television. There was no immediate comment by Russia, which in the past has denied hitting civilian targets. The attack was the deadliest in the Kharkiv region since Russia’s invasion began more than 19 months ago, a regional official told public broadcaster Suspilne. It appeared to be one of the biggest civilian death tolls in any single Russian strike. Footage released by Ukrainian authorities showed rescue workers sifting through piles of rubble and bodies coated in dust laid out next to the site of the attack. Klymenko cited preliminary information that he said showed the attack was carried out with an Iskander ballistic missile. “The terrorists deliberately carried out the attack during lunchtime to ensure a maximum number of casualties,” Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said. “There were no military targets there. This is a heinous crime intended to scare Ukrainians.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was attending a summit with European leaders in Spain, said: “Russian terror should be stopped.” I’ve just visited Kharkiv, the city of 1.2 million people. Border with Russia is less than 40 km away. Less than 3 minutes for a S-300 missile. Russia terrorizes the city with them and has already destroyed thousands of houses, schools, universities, power plants, and transport. — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) October 5, 2023  Zelenskyy called on Western countries to redouble their support for Ukraine’s war effort and air defence systems. A spokesman for the head of the United Nations said he “strongly condemns” the attack. “Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law, and they must stop immediately,” Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said in a statement. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a message posted by his office on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that he was “shocked and saddened” by the attack. “Our human rights monitors will visit the site to gather information. Accountability is key,” he said. Maria Adeeva, the research director at the European Expert Association in Ukraine, said the Hroza attack was “clearly deliberate”. “Russians knew that all those people were there, and they precisely attacked this building,” Adeeva told Al Jazeera. “This strike was so huge that from what we know now, only 30 bodies are being able to be identified from 51 people killed so that means that 20 bodies still aren’t identified,” she said.

       "  'Date': '5 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': \"Russian sea mines warning comes as Ukrainian navy says 12 cargo vessels preparing to travel to Ukraine Black Sea ports. Russia may use sea mines against civilian shipping in the Black Sea, including by laying them on the approach to Ukrainian ports, the United Kingdom has said citing intelligence sources. The warning comes as Ukraine’s navy said that 12 cargo vessels were ready to enter a fledgling Black Sea shipping corridor on their way to Ukrainian ports, a significant increase in maritime traffic to Ukraine in defiance of a de facto Russian blockade of the country’s sea ports. The UK’s foreign office said in a statement on Wednesday that intelligence assessments indicated that Russia was considering the use of sea mines to deter civilian ships travelling through a “humanitarian corridor” established by Ukraine to facilitate grain exports from the Black Sea ports. “Russia almost certainly wants to avoid openly sinking civilian ships, instead falsely laying blame on Ukraine for any attacks against civilian vessels in the Black Sea,” the Foreign Office said in a statement. “By releasing our assessment of this intelligence, the UK seeks to expose Russia’s tactics to deter any such incident from occurring,” it added.      The UK’s Foreign Secretary James Cleverly was quoted as saying that “the world is watching” what unfolds in the Black Sea and “Russia’s cynical attempts to lay blame on Ukraine for their attacks”. Russia pulled out of a deal in July that had allowed Ukraine to safely ship food products out through the Black Sea, which is traditionally its main export corridor. Moscow shortly after announced that ships in the vicinity of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports would be considered potential supporters of Kyiv’s war efforts and “parties to the Ukrainian conflict”. Russia has also stepped up aerial attacks on Ukraine’s ports with drones and missile raids that have so far damaged 130 infrastructure facilities and destroyed nearly 300,000 tonnes of grain – enough to feed more than one million people for a year, the UK said.      Ukraine responded by setting up a temporary “humanitarian corridor” on the Black Sea for cargo vessels willing to risk travelling to its ports, and several ships have since used the route. On Wednesday, Ukrainian Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said that more than 20 ships were preparing to exit and enter Ukraine’s sea ports. “In total to enter the new corridor we have 12, and 10 to leave. That is as of now,” Pletenchuk said, though he did not say when the vessels were expected to sail. Ukrainian defence forces are doing everything to ensure the safety of civilian ships in Ukraine’s territorial waters, he said, and the vessels were also proceeding into the waters of Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey, all of which are NATO member countries. At least seven new ships have entered Ukrainian waters in the past several days, and they are due to ship abroad at least 127,000 tonnes of Ukrainian-origin grain, local Ukrainian officials and lawmakers said. Kyiv has also increased exports from its ports on the Danube river to Romania and then onwards by road to international markets. Since the end of the grain deal, Ukraine’s attacks on Russia’s Black Sea fleet in the Moscow-annexed Crimean peninsula and the port city of Sevastopol have increased.      Attacks by Kyiv on Sevastopol were likely responsible for Moscow recently transferring the Black Sea fleet vessel from Crimea to the Russian port of Novorossiysk in the Krasnodar Krai region of Russia, Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said in its latest Ukraine war monitoring report. Satellite imagery between October 1 and 3 showed that Russia had transferred 10 vessels to Novorossiysk from Sevastopol, the ISW said.

The UK also said that it was working with Kyiv and other partners to improve the safety of Ukrainian shipping, and was using its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities to monitor Russian activity in the Black Sea.

       "  'Text': 'What happened in the 84th week of Russia’s war in Ukraine? Russian and Ukrainian forces remained largely static on the battlefield in the 84th week of the war after a month of vigorous Ukrainian advances that saw Kyiv break through the first of three Russian lines of defence on the southern front. Still, Ukraine proved it could hold onto its gains against Russian counterattacks and even made a few advances. Russian forces appeared to have lost a kilometre-long (0.6-mile-long) trench west of Verbove, a village on the front line of the main Ukrainian thrust through Russian defences in the Zaporizhia region in southeastern Ukraine. Vladimir Rogov, an occupation official, said at least four companies of Ukrainian troops had launched an attack on the trench on September 26 supported by armoured fighting vehicles. Geolocated footage that Russian sources released the following day confirmed that Ukraine held the position it had stormed. Verbove sits on the eastern side of a U-shaped salient into Russian-occupied territory in western Zaporizhia. Ukrainian forces also mounted an attack on Russian positions north of Robotyne, a town on the eastern side of that salient, on Thursday. Russian units posted that the assault was insufficiently supported by armour and was repulsed. Ukraine also appears to have fought for – and held – a trench system south of Robotyne against a Russian attempt to recapture it on Sunday. A Ukrainian soldier analysing the footage described the system as “a strongpoint in an interconnected system of trenches, firing systems and dugouts that lie between Robotyne and Novoprokopivka”, Ukraine’s next target on the eastern side of its salient. The system was interconnected by tunnels and Russia was prioritising its defence, the soldier told the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington, DC-based think tank. Although Ukrainian assault forces have taken over Russian trenches and are using them to their own advantage, their slow assault tactics of using platoon-sized units to take Russian positions one at a time has deprived them of the ability to achieve a breakthrough, according to an assessment by the independent Russian newspaper Meduza. Those tactics have allowed the retreating Russians to keep rebuilding defences and forcing the Ukrainians to continue to move slowly. This reality, Meduza said, has kept Ukrainian troops stuck in a triangle between Robotyne, Novoprokopivka and Verbove, and it forecast rains could slow them further. The head of Britain’s armed forces, Admiral Tony Radakin, told War on the Rocks, an American podcast, of his belief that Russian defences had turned out stronger than the West had anticipated and predicted a long war lay ahead after Ukraine failed to achieve a breakthrough in its summer counteroffensive. He also said Russian President Vladimir Putin has lost control of the war he started and Ukraine would ultimately win. Radakin has previously said he believed Russia has lost half its combat capability in Ukraine. Ukraine said it successfully continued its long-distance attacks on Russian soil. A Ukrainian drone dropped two bombs on an electricity substation in the Russian village of Belaya near the Ukrainian border, setting the substation alight on Friday. Kursk Governor Roman Starovoyt reported the attack on Telegram. “One of the transformers caught fire. Five settlements and a hospital were cut off from power supply. Fire crews rushed to the scene,” he said. Ukraine’s military intelligence said on Sunday that it had disrupted the production of Russian Kh-59 missiles, which have a range of 280km (175 miles), when its drones struck the Smolensk plant where they are made. “Three out of four drones hit the target, causing significant damage to the production facilities,” its military intelligence said. Russia has consistently used Kh-59 cruise missiles to hit infrastructure and civilian targets in Ukraine. “When we work out certain actions on the objects of the defence industrial complex, we have only one goal: to slow down the production of Russian weapons,” military intelligence chief Kiril Budanov told NV television. He said attacks on the Russian border by anti-Putin Russian militias were ongoing and had recently claimed the lives of border guards and Federal Security Service (FSB) personnel. Ukraine also has focused on building up its defence industry, which has produced the missiles, aerial drones and surface naval drones that have enabled long-distance attacks on Russian targets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the start of a new defence industrial programme on Saturday that would be funded partly by confiscated Russian assets. Representatives from several countries attended the first meeting of what he called a Defence Industries Forum, through which Ukraine plans to draw on international expertise, funding and technology. “Manufacturers of weapons and military equipment from all over the world can join its basic declaration and demonstrate that they are ready to build the arsenal of the free world together with Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said. “The fund will be replenished from dividends from state defence assets and from profits from sale of confiscated Russian assets.” The chairwoman of the German Bundestag Defence Committee, Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmerman, called for the immediate delivery of Taurus missiles to Ukraine in the wake of the US decision to supply 300km-range (186-mile-range) Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, in late September. The German-made Taurus is a stealth cruise missile with a range of 500km (310 miles). Germany has consistently followed the US is the supply of new military technologies to Ukraine. Strack-Zimmerman said strikes against Crimea using Taurus missiles would be legitimate because the Russian army was supplied through that territory. “International law allows Ukraine to attack military targets and on the territory [of Russia] completely regardless of where the gun is made and who supplies it,” she was reported as saying. There was also possible bad news on the rearmament front. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said there “could be impacts to training” of Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets due to a looming US government shutdown. While military personnel would continue to implement the programme, government-contracted civilian interpreters might not, she said. Far-right Republicans in the US Congress have refused to fund the US government if spending bills also include aid to Ukraine. Congress has funded the government until the middle of November through a stopgap measure that cost Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy his job. The European Union, which has provided Ukraine with 77 billion euros ($81bn) in financial and military aid during the war, may also be witnessing fatigue. Robert Fico, a former Slovak prime minister, won parliamentary elections in the Central European country on Saturday on a pro-Russia platform.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine – We meet Yulia in the early morning. The autumn weather, still sunny, has turned sharp, and we all wish we’d brought warmer jackets. She is the coordinator for Ukraine’s emergency and rescue services, in charge of distributing aid to villages just behind the frontlines, where normal life has long since vanished. Organised yet sanguine, we are clearly not the first media team she has shepherded. The drive towards the front takes a good hour, the signs of war more evident by the kilometre. Civilian and military vehicles speed up the closer we get. No one wants to become a target. We arrive at an aid distribution centre, a fire station with a tarp roof, an old fire engine and a newer ambulance as its centre pieces. A small crowd of expectant villagers has gathered. Before the war, Orikhiv was a town of 14,000 people. Now, just hundreds live here. Old men and women gather in a small chatty knot. I briefly blush with shame as I stand next to them in full body armour while they natter in old clothes and slippers. One woman gives us a glance with a gentle smile on her face, feet encased in floral crocs; her only protection is a pair of earbuds she has in the whole time. I wonder why, and as if on cue, the sharp bang from a nearby artillery battery reminds me. The barrage isn’t intense but a regular reminder of the proximity of the conflict, the whizz of an occasional Russian shell in reply. No one bats an eyelid. Receiving bread and bottles of water, the small crowd disperses, leaving as good-natured as they came but with armfuls of loaves, most on slow bikes back home. There isn’t an intact house in the entire town. Street after street, building after building lie shattered, roofs smashed in, doors and windows boarded up or left open to the coming cold. In the distance, the singular sound of a hammer on wood as the residents, old yet resilient, repair what they can, putting up with what they can’t. We follow a fire tender on its way to deliver water to a home nearby. Empty barrels wait to be filled by the open door. An angry woman storms out and shouts at both us and the firemen, complaining that she is fed up with the food they bring, that it’s never enough, and that the presence of journalists will bring attacks upon her family. The firemen start filling the barrels, doing their best to ignore her, but these are local volunteers caring for local people, and the discomfort is evident. Her fury doesn’t mask the despair in her voice as she tells us her house was destroyed at the beginning of the war, and she, her disabled husband, and several others, have lived in the basement ever since. We pause for a bit before the next location. Yulia quickly munches on an apple, her helmet off for once, then we head across the road from the aid centre. An old man\\xa0 – all the young people have left – is up a ladder banging at an exposed roofing joist, working methodically as the weather is due to turn bad soon. Unsweetened grapes hang unpicked from his trellis vine as he takes us into his back garden where a crater, nine metres wide and three deep, occupies the centre. He is interviewed by the crater’s lip, telling us it was caused by a KAB 500, a precision-guided munition with a 500kg (1100-pound) warhead. Living in his smashed home has taken its toll. “You are living, but it’s hard on the soul … we had a life here,” he says. Next to the house, white-marked trails from the tracks of tanks run along the tarmacked road. An APC loudly rumbles towards the front. A military pickup truck with a flat tire slowly trundles squeakily past in the opposite direction;\\xa0exhausted soldiers in the back, matted with dust, stare at us blankly. Walking through the deserted streets looking for a good spot to shoot our “piece to camera”, we come across an intersection, an abandoned church with a smashed spire on the corner. Police immediately pull up in a van, ask us who we are, impressing on us that a crossroads isn’t perhaps the safest place to film. They tell us to listen out for Russian spotter drones. A Ukrainian colleague jokes, “Better be quick”. The whoosh of Grad rockets being launched from a battery close by makes us wary of incoming return fire, and we decide to pack up. On a gate on the other side of the road, a gang of sparrows, oblivious to the destruction, tweet and jostle each other for position.

       "  'Date': '4 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'As Slovakia votes for a pro-Russia politician, Poland drops military aid, and the US wavers; Ukraine is likely worried but not yet panicking, analysts say. On Sunday, Slovakia’s former Prime Minister Robert Fico, a left-wing populist, won parliamentary elections with his SMER-SSD party, having campaigned on a promise to withdraw military support for Ukraine and stop sanctioning Russia. It sent a worrying signal to Kyiv, which in recent weeks has been rowing with one of its staunchest allies, Poland, over the issue of Ukrainian grain imports, while watching on as US Republican lawmakers threaten to scupper a new aid deal. These developments have stirred talk of a global shift in sentiment towards supporting Ukraine as the war grinds on, more than a year and a half after it began. According to Teona Lavrelashvili, an analyst at the European Politics Centre, they could signal that several allies are ready for a “pragmatic solution” to the end of the war,. But Kyiv will be “worried but not panicking” by the growing sense that some traditional allies have “fallen out of step”, said Sean Hanley, an associate professor in Comparative Central and East European Politics at University College London. Fico still needs to form a coalition, but the pro-Kremlin, anti-Kyiv rhetoric that saw his party win marked a significant departure from Slovakia’s position since the start of the war. As recently as April, Slovak President Zuzana Caputova travelled to Kyiv in what had been a then-routine show of support. Hanley told Al Jazeera that Kyiv will likely be concerned about the Slovak pivot towards Russia because it signals that “Ukraine fatigue” is setting in among allies, while fears of Slovakia’s military aid potentially being cut are less worrying. Even so, pro-Kremlin sentiment in Slovakian politics, Hanley said, is not as widespread as in countries such as Serbia or Bulgaria. Instead, you see more “Ukraine-sceptic” views that prioritise national interests over international causes, as populist illiberal trends challenge “the idea that you’ve got to emulate the West”. Kyiv will also be concerned by Slovakia potentially joining Hungary in carving out a Ukraine-sceptic alliance within the European Union bloc. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has maintained close relations with Moscow during the war and argued against supplying arms to Ukraine or providing economic aid. On Sunday, Orban congratulated Fico with a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, saying: “Guess who’s back! … Always good to work together with a patriot.” This budding friendship represents a shift. Previously, relations were strained between Slovak and Hungarian nationalists, according to Hanley. Now, he said, there is a departure from “traditional kind of nationalist enmities whereby you pick a fight with the guy next door” to “culture wars” with the focus on scepticism of the rest of the EU, of LGBTQ rights, feminism and potential immigration from non-European countries.      Lavrelashvili said although Slovakia will now likely “be a troublemaker” regarding the EU’s support of Ukraine, bombastic rhetoric often gives way to a more pragmatic approach to diplomacy. It is a trait that Fico has often displayed, according to Hanley, who said for him to become leader, he must compromise with another party to form a coalition. Observers also say Slovakia, with the eurozone’s biggest budget deficit of nearly 7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year, needs EU modernisation and recovery funds, meaning Fico may think twice before aggravating Brussels. Since the outbreak of the war in February 2022, Poland has been one of Kyiv’s most committed allies. The country, which shares a border with the war-torn nation, hosts millions of Ukrainian refugees, has transferred an array of weapons to Kyiv’s army in its fight against Russia, and acted as a transit hub for arms shipments from other nations.  But in recent weeks, a seemingly unbreakable bond began to crack as the neighbours rowed over Ukrainian grain imports, leading Poland to announce that it would no longer send arms to Ukraine and may cut aid to refugees. Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland’s prime minister, warned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to never “insult” Poles again after the Ukrainian leader told the United Nations that “political theatre” around grain imports was helping Moscow’s cause. The dispute began in September when Poland imposed restrictions on Ukrainian grain imports in a bid to protect local farmers. Ukraine was enraged and the two nations traded warnings repeatedly, setting the stage for a row that played out in the international arena. Robert Pszczel, a senior fellow at the Casimir Pulaski Foundation in Poland, told Al Jazeera that despite the “unpleasant rhetoric” between the two nations, key strategic support for Ukraine will not change. He said the recent spat is a culmination of various ongoing rifts, including an incident in November, during which an air defence missile killed two people in southern Poland. At the time, Poland and NATO said a Ukrainian missile likely caused the deaths but that Russia bore ultimate responsibility, having instigated the war. Kyiv denied any responsibility. But Lavrelashvili said Poland and Slovakia cannot be compared. In Slovakia, pro-Kremlin narratives have been more successful in influencing society, creating an East-West divide among those who now view the United States as a “security threat”, she said. Poland, however, has not changed its view of Russia as a dangerous force. Instead, the discussions around Ukraine have revolved around balancing national interests while continuing some form of support.

At a NATO summit in July, US President Joe Biden reassured G7 leaders and President Zelenskyy, “Our commitment to Ukraine will not weaken.” But late on Sunday, a compromise reached in US Congress to prevent a government shutdown saw a new funding deal for Ukraine abandoned, largely because of resistance from hardline Republicans. The subsequent removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House of Representatives has added to the uncertainty around aid for Ukraine. Joshua Tucker, head of the Jordan Center for the Advanced Study of Russia and professor of politics at New York University, told Al Jazeera the stopgap bill should be viewed “in the context of the very peculiar situation of US domestic politics at this point in time”. He said the bill was forced by a small section of the Republican Party and does not reflect an overarching shift in US politics. Instead, support for Ukraine will depend more on the direction former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, chooses to take. Tucker explained that in the US, the political narrative around Ukraine is focused on whether the government is spending too much money on the war, unlike in Europe, where there is more of a desire for the “conflict to be over” because of its direct effect on energy prices and quality of life. Perhaps sensing this shift, most EU foreign ministers convened outside the bloc for the first time this week, visiting Kyiv on Monday in a public display of unwavering solidarity, while Poland and Hungary sent representatives. “I don’t see any member state faltering,” Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, said after promising Ukraine billions of euros in military aid and training for fighter pilots. On Tuesday, President Biden assured his counterparts by phone that he remains confident Congress will approve aid for Ukraine, “for as long as it takes”.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'US President Joe Biden faces hardening scepticism from Republicans over aid to Kyiv. What does this mean for Ukraine? As campaigning for next year’s United States presidential election heats up, Ukraine has emerged as a central theme. President Joe Biden is currently scrambling to muster support for a new aid package for the war-torn country, facing hardening scepticism from Republicans in a deeply divided Congress. His challenge just got harder, with hardline Republicans pushing through a vote that on Tuesday led to the ouster of the party’s own House of Representatives speaker, Joe McCarthy. So what does this presage for Ukraine? Is the US, the country’s staunchest ally to date, about to scale down its generous aid packages? And, given its role in rallying support across the West, will others waver? Recent developments, which saw Congress ditch provisions for further funding to avert a government shutdown, sent shock waves across the Atlantic. Biden is now pressing members of Congress to back a separate deal for Ukraine funding. He was relying on support from McCarthy, who was however removed from office on Tuesday. Prior to his dramatic departure, McCarthy had already raised members’ concerns about accountability regarding funds sent to Kyiv. With some of his potential successors strongly in favour of continuing funding and others strongly opposed, who succeeds him could influence the flow of US aid to Ukraine – and potentially the direction of the war that started with Russia’s full-fledged invasion of its eastern neighbour in February 2022. In the midst of the head-spinning drama, Biden had told Congress on October 1 that the “vast majority” of both parties in the Senate and Congress backed Ukraine in their fight against Russia’s “brutal aggression”. However, while senators from both parties have shown unity on the subject, with dozens attending a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his visit to Washington in September, the House is more polarised. Republicans control the chamber by a narrow 221-212 majority. The battle was thrown into sharp focus on Monday, October 2, when billionaire Elon Musk lashed out at Kyiv on his X social media platform (formerly Twitter), posting a meme featuring Zelenskyy with the caption: “When it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars in aid”. pic.twitter.com/W9i9YEM8uA — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 1, 2023 Ukraine’s parliament hit back on its official X account, posting a meme of Musk with the words: “When it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t spread Russian propaganda”. Last month, Russian president Vladimir Putin hailed Musk as an “outstanding person” after revelations that the entrepreneur had stymied a Ukrainian attack on Russian-occupied Crimea last year, issuing orders that his Starlink satellite communications be turned off. Musk had allegedly feared Moscow would retaliate with nuclear weapons. The US has thus far been a major backer of Kyiv, providing over $113bn in military, humanitarian and economic aid. Military spending, which accounts for more than half of US aid, pays for the drones, tanks and missiles crucial to the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive. Humanitarian assistance provides for medical supplies and essentials like food and safe drinking water for the displaced population.  Republican opponents of aid argue that the money should be spent on domestic concerns, such as border security, law and order, and relief for climate-related natural disasters hitting the country with increasing frequency. Aid to Ukraine is a considerable fraction of the $773bn defence budget request for 2023. It is far more than the $25bn slated for border security this year — a key bugbear for conservatives. Department of Defense (DoD) Comptroller Michael McCord last month attempted to bring McCarthy onside, explaining that the Pentagon had already scaled down support. In a letter to the speaker, dated September 29, he highlighted the impact of foreign security assistance on jobs and production in congressional districts, mentioning facilities in Tuscon, Arizona and Camden, Arkansas. Money is running low. As McCord pointed out, the DoD has only $1.6bn left to replenish military stocks flowing to Ukraine and a mere $5.4bn worth of Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA). The Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) has now been exhausted. But, as the presidential campaign intensifies, such pleas are likely to go unheard. Military aid is simply not regarded as a winning campaign strategy. Hardline Republicans like Gaetz, a supporter of Donald Trump, the latter seeking re-election to the White House next year, look set to continue their drumbeat against aid in the coming months. On October 3, the White House announced that Biden had spoken to the leaders of allied countries about continuing coordinated support. In his annual address to the UN General Assembly last month, Biden attempted to counter war fatigue, which has become apparent in Europe, most notably in Poland and Slovakia. “Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalise Ukraine without consequence,” he said. “But I ask you this: If we abandon the core principles of the United States to appease an aggressor, can any member state in this body feel confident that they’re protected?” Beyond multilateralism, it’s also clear the US’s reputation as a global leader, shaken by its chaotic exit from Afghanistan in 2021, would suffer drastically if it walked away from Ukraine. Can Washington afford this at a time of rising tensions with Beijing? None of this would have come as a surprise to Zelenskyy, struggling to beat back Russian forces before another harsh winter sets in. On his visit to Washington last month, dressed in military green, he reportedly described the situation to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in the baldest of terms. “If we don’t get the aid, we will lose the war,” he said.

       "  'Text': 'And what could be next for the Russian mercenary group in Ukraine, after Yevgeny Prigozhin’s death? Kyiv, Ukraine – The lean, grey-haired man lying on the asphalt was so drunk he couldn’t utter his own name. Ambulance workers found Andrei Troshev near a nine-storey apartment building in uptown St Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city, on June 5, 2017, according to the independent Fontanka.ru news portal. The inebriated Troshev had about $25,000 in cash, maps of Syria and purchase documents for tents intended for Russian forces fighting for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, Fontanka.ru reported, citing hospital records. The 61-year-old, whose nom de guerre is “Sedoy” (“Grey-haired”), turned out to be one of the top officers of the Wagner mercenary group, which had formed a couple of years earlier. “He is a typical character for Wagner,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera. Just like many other staffers of the security wing of Concorde, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin’s multifaceted company, Troshev fought in the Soviet-Afghan war and later joined the police force in St Petersburg, Mitrokhin said. On June 23, Troshev made a fateful decision – he refused to take part in Wagner’s aborted mutiny in Russia and was not in the private jet with Prigozhin and his top officers that crashed in western Russia on August 23. Since the mutiny, Wagner has left Ukraine and fractured, no longer playing a part in Moscow’s faltering war effort. Some of its veterans have been lured to smaller private armies put together by state-run corporations or Kremlin-friendly oligarchs. Some found a haven in Belarus, whose hardline president, Alexander Lukashenko, strengthened his law enforcement agencies in his power play with Russia. And some are garrisoned in several African nations, whose leaders gave Wagner access to mineral riches and raw materials in exchange for security services. The Kremlin did not want entire Wagner units back on the Ukrainian battlefields because they proved too unruly as Prigozhin engaged in widely publicised conflicts with Russia’s top brass, military analysts said. “Whole Wagner Group units could lead to problems of Russian Ministry of Defence’s control as experienced under Prigozhin,” retired US army Major General Gordon Skip Davis Jr told Al Jazeera. “Former Wagner veterans, however, could provide needed tactical expertise and small unit leadership to Russian formations,” he said. These new formations will be helmed by Troshev even though he played a nefarious role in one of the bloodiest defeats Wagner has ever faced. In February 2018, he and Prigozhin reportedly ordered an attack on an oil- and gasfield near the eastern Syrian town of Khasham without knowing that the area was controlled by US forces and the Syrian opposition. Wagner suffered a humiliating defeat and heavy losses in what became the first post-Cold War armed clash of Russian and US nationals. However, Troshev was awarded the Hero of Russia medal for his service in Syria. Prigozhin’s mutiny began after the Defence Ministry said each Wagner fighter had to sign contracts to become part of the military machine known for corruption, ineffectiveness and miscalculations that proved lethal to thousands of Russian servicemen. Prigozhin ultimately refused to sign these contracts, increasing tensions. And it is these contracts that are exactly what Troshev is after these days. On Saturday, Troshev, clad in a bespoke dark-blue suit common among Russian officials, was filmed in the Kremlin heeding President Vladimir Putin. Putin told him to “form volunteer battalions” that would include Wagner fighters. “You know what it’s like, how it’s done. You know about the issues that need to be resolved in advance so that combat work goes on in the best and most successful way,” Putin said. But the task is doomed because of Troshev’s reputation within Wagner, analysts said. “The core of most battle-tested Wagnerites is not joining him for sure,” Kyiv-based analyst Maria Kucherenko, who authored several in-depth reports on Wagner, told Al Jazeera. Troshev also faces a new rival. Prigozhin’s son and heir, Pavel, is “making a deal with the Russian national guard so that Wagner returns to Ukraine for a certain task without signing a contract,” Kucherenko said. Wagner mercenaries will also fight “under their own insignia” of a human skull against a black and red backdrop, she added. However, it’s crystal clear who would control these mercenary groups. “One can shuffle these alcoholic pensioners, one can make up a dozen noms de guerre, but the essence doesn’t change – both kinds of crap are controlled from [Russia’s] general staff of armed forces,” she said. Meanwhile, the Kremlin is pressuring the Wagner fighters in Africa who are reluctant to sign up for service in Ukraine by “deliberately blocking supply chains”, Mitrokhin said. As a result, a Telegram channel with ties to the Russian military and Wagner claimed that “three stormtrooper squads” flew from Africa to Ukraine last week. The deployment followed a deal between their commanders and Russia’s national guard to sign individual and group contracts, the Russian pro-war Telegram channel Rybar claimed. It’s not clear where the units are going, but their arrival will “contribute to the fall-winter campaign”, it said. So far, Ukrainian intelligence reported the return of about 500 Wagner fighters to the front lines and said their presence is not expected to crucially change the deadlock. At Wagner’s height in June, Prigozhin bragged he had 25,000 fighters, who were largely recruited from prisons, Davis said. They played a key role in capturing the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut “at \\xa0great cost in casualties”, he said. Therefore, “some 500 men are not likely to make any significant impact, especially if dispersed among various Russian units”, Davis concluded.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

Ukraine plans to build its first fully underground school in the eastern city of Kharkiv to shield students from Russian bomb and missile attacks, the city’s mayor said. Parts of Kharkiv City, which is located less than 35km (20 miles) from the Russian border, have been subjected to nearly daily Russian aerial attacks, which can strike before residents have time to reach underground shelters. “We are planning to build Ukraine’s first underground school, which will address the most modern regulatory requirements for protective structures,” Kharkiv’s Mayor Ihor Terekhov wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “This shelter will allow thousands of children in Kharkiv to continue safe, in-person education even during missile threats,” Terekhov said. The mayor did not provide details on when the school will open but noted that authorities in Kharkiv would not reduce spending on education in the 2023-24 period, “despite the lack of funds from the budget”, the independent, Russian-language news site Meduza reported on Tuesday.      \\xa0 While Ukrainian schools in front-line areas have been forced to move online throughout the war, Kharkiv organised some 60 separate classrooms throughout its metro stations before the beginning of the new school year on September 1, creating space for more than 1,000 children to study safely. Ukraine’s Ministry of Education says that 363 educational institutions have been destroyed and nearly 3,800 damaged throughout the country since the war began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Kharkiv, which is Ukraine’s second-largest city, had a pre-war population of more than 1.4 million. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region of which the city of Kharkiv is the administrative centre, said that in the 24 hours to Monday, one civilian was killed and several houses damaged as a result of Russia’s shelling and rocket attacks.

       "  'Text': 'While Western assistance for Ukraine remains robust, critics of that support have become increasingly vocal in EU and US. The European Union has brushed aside questions over whether the bloc will remain committed to assisting Ukraine in the long term as schisms over the issue begin to form in the United States and Europe. A delegation of EU foreign ministers made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Monday, offering an image of cohesion and reiterating their support for the country’s struggle against Russia’s invasion. “The EU remains united in its support to Ukraine. … I don’t see any member state folding on their engagement,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters. Borrell described the gathering as “historic” but made clear there would be no new concrete announcements. “It is the first time that we met in a candidate country. And unfortunately, it was also the first time that the foreign ministers of the European Union met in a country at war,” he said at a press conference. When we are together, we are stronger. The EU is and remains Ukraine’s first supporter. Thank you @ZelenskyyUa and @DmytroKuleba for hosting us today. pic.twitter.com/HyGBhrdbqE — Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF) October 2, 2023  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the ministers the duration of the war – now in its 20th month – was linked to the quality and quantity of support Ukraine receives from its allies. “Our victory directly depends on our cooperation: the more strong and principled steps we take together, the sooner this war will end,” Zelenskyy said in a statement. To bring about a speedy end to fighting, he urged the EU to expand sanctions on Russia and Iran, which has supplied attack drones for Russian forces. And he called for the “acceleration” of work to direct “frozen Russian assets to finance the restoration of war-torn Ukraine”.      The Kyiv meeting was convened amid growing signs that Western support for assistance to Ukraine is becoming more fractured. In the US, right-wing conservatives have become increasingly vocal in their attacks on US support, and a former Slovakian prime minister who promised “not a single round” of assistance led his party to victory in parliamentary elections over the weekend. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has also become more critical of Kyiv in recent months and said Hungary is in no rush to approve Sweden’s accession to NATO. Some countries in the Global South have also cooled on efforts by countries like the US to rally support for Ukraine. They have been hammered economically by the war and are sceptical of being forced to choose between amicable relations with either the West or Russia.      As the war grinds on, supporters of Ukraine worry that governments and voters could lose interest in the conflict and move away from commitments to provide Kyiv with essential military and economic support. “Our victory directly depends on our cooperation: the more strong and principled steps we take together, the sooner this war will end,” Zelenskyy said in a statement after meeting the foreign ministers. In both the US and the EU, however, support for assistance remains widespread and substantial. “The vast majority of both parties – Democrats and Republicans, Senate and House – support helping Ukraine and the brutal aggression that is being thrust upon them by Russia,” US President Joe Biden said on Sunday as assistance to Ukraine figured in negotiations to avoid a government shutdown. The US avoided a shutdown by passing a short-term spending package that did not include support for Ukraine.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '2 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'A founding member of the punk feminist art collective, who is on Russia’s most wanted list, talks to Al Jazeera about Ukraine, women’s rights, and the threats she faces. Nadya Tolokonnikova, an artist and activist, was placed on Russia’s most wanted list in March. Weeks earlier, she had released an irreverent short film entitled Putin’s Ashes, in which a group of women from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus, dressed in lingerie and wearing red balaclavas, press the nuclear button and set alight a 10-foot portrait of the Russian president. “Join our movement against the most dangerous living dictator on the planet,” reads the caption accompanying the three-minute clip. A member of Pussy Riot, the Russian feminist protest art collective formed in 2011, she was reportedly accused by Moscow of “insulting the religious feelings of believers”. She has recently spent much of her time focused on the conflict in Ukraine, raising nearly $7m for Ukrainian war efforts through her cryptocurrency UkraineDAO. She has also curated My Body, My Business at Sotheby’s in support of abortion rights in the United States. Al Jazeera spoke with Tolokonnikova, who currently lives outside of Russia, about her art, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and her views on Moscow’s crackdown on dissent. Al Jazeera: You’ve spent several years in the kind of penal colonies dissidents will now be detained in. What is life like there, in terms of conditions and treatment, and do you think these sites have changed in nature since the war began? Nadya Tolokonnikova: A lot of things have changed since I was in jail, and I was hoping they would change for the better. I’d noticed a few main things to tackle in the Russian prison system: First, we need to get rid of forced labour. We still have this gulag Soviet inheritance of forced labour. Second is the lack of medical treatment – many prisoners die from treatable conditions. And lastly, living conditions. A lot of those facilities have not been updated since the gulag times. A lot of people still live in barracks, in very depressing conditions, often with no access to running water. We would go for weeks sometimes without being able to wash ourselves or our clothes. When I got out of jail, I was hoping that I’d be able to change it. And I did talk to some people who were leaving government offices at the time because it was still 2014, so some people from the opposition were still in government. We were hoping they were going to be able to bring prison reform in Russia. But instead, Russia went back to the new dark ages, starting with the war. It’s the same thing with feminist rights and LGBTQ+ people’s rights. Today, we cannot have any constructive conversations about the rights of prisoners, many of whom are being sent to the warzone to fight for the Russian side. They’re being used as canon meat for the war. Al Jazeera: How do you characterise the state of women’s rights in Russia, and how has the war in Ukraine impacted the struggle for gender equality? Tolokonnikova: With the beginning of the war in Ukraine, it became practically impossible to run a truly independent non-profit. And since our government does not really care about women’s rights, everything [is impacted] – from helping victims of domestic violence, to providing shelters for women, to fighting for our rights in the courts. In Russia, our self-defence law doesn’t work; if a woman killed someone who was threatening her or beating her up, she is sentenced for murder. And the only person who can help her is a human rights lawyer who could argue self-defence. But the government, or judge, or prosecutor, or cops – they don’t let you do that. So really the only people who can help women in Russia are women themselves and the non-profit sector. But the non-profits in this space that were actually legitimate and useful and independent – not just government puppets – were labelled as foreign agents [after the war erupted]. And most of the founders and members of those had to leave Russia because in the last couple of years, even projects that are not directly connected to politics – like helping women or protecting victims of domestic violence. Anna Rivina, the founder of nasiliu.net (No to Violence), Russia’s most prominent anti-domestic violence organisation, [who anticipated the increase in gender-based violence with the onset of the war in Ukraine] was labelled a foreign agent and had to leave Russia. There are numerous cases like this. When you have an extraordinary situation like this, when your country wages war, the conversations around human rights are set back hundreds of years. Nobody talks about feminism anymore or LGBTQ+ rights. There’s no one left in Russia who can talk about it. People are trying to help from the outside. Al Jazeera: What do you think awaits you if you were to return to Russia? Tolokonnikova: I currently have a criminal case opened on me for one of the works I did earlier this year for Putin’s Ashes, a performance that we showed for the first time at Jeffrey Deitch Gallery in LA. They used the Pussy Riot article, which they quite literally created while we were under investigation. They created this article in 2012 about hurting religious feelings. And it’s unclear how I was hurting religious feelings with my art, to me at least. [Editor’s note: Pussy Riot members including Tolokonnikova were charged in 2012 with “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred” after performing called Punk Prayer in Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, a song which attacked Putin and the Orthodox establishment.] If I go to Russia I’ll be immediately arrested. It was funny at first, and then I realised this comes with a price. The Russian passport is the only one I have, and it basically pretty much makes me a stateless person with few rights in the world. The only country that is supposed to protect my interests and defend my rights is the one which wants me poisoned, dead, or in jail. It does not feel good to be unprotected and stateless and having lots of troubles with travelling. Travel is very important for our job as activists and artists, and that creates complications. Al Jazeera: As an artist – and I know your politics and your art are inextricable – can you talk about how your aesthetic has developed? How have you found your artistic voice? Tolokonnikova: Contrasts are always very important for me. When we were coming up with the name Pussy Riot, we combined something traditionally seen as welcoming, cozy, nice, cute, sometimes even weak – that’s how people see it for some reason – with riot, which is the opposite of it. Contrasts are part of the Pussy Riot look, too. We have bold masks on our faces – they are purple, pink or neon. Yet at the same time, they’re not threatening, they’re still colourful so we signify we came with peace, not war or violence. And we wore very feminine dresses, which is not our everyday attire. When you’re running away from cops, it’s much easier to do it in pants rather than a bright colourful dress, but we decided to use it on purpose to show that femininity can be strong and bold, and riotous and rebellious, contrary to what a lot of people still believe. Al Jazeera: I see that contrast in your recent Putin’s Ashes work – the soft, plush frames combined with splattered blood, or traces of violence… Tolokonnikova: If you see Putin’s Ashes, it features women in practically lingerie. It’s important for me to state the fact that a woman can look how she wants to look. But it doesn’t take away anything from what she has to say. I think across the world really, conservatives are trying to push women into wearing something specific to be taken seriously. Al Jazeera: Can artistic production help people suffering within authoritarian regimes? Tolokonnikova: I think it can help on the emotional level. In my work, I try to combine my art with direct activism that influences people’s wellbeing, like helping prisoners or raising money for Ukraine, and making sure that I help someone in a very constructive and pragmatic manner. Art has a much more subtle influence on things, but it doesn’t mean that it’s less needed. A lot of us are talking specifically about Russian people and Russians who do not support Putin. A lot of us have this open wound after the war started. And we don’t really know how to talk about it, because obviously, our suffering cannot be compared to the suffering of Ukrainians. We still feel that wound and we cannot talk about it because it’s almost unethical. [Through my art, I’m trying to give a voice to], or at least acknowledge, the feelings of those people in Russia who feel unrepresented and silenced. If they decide to stay in Russia they cannot talk anymore, otherwise they’ll just end up in jail for dozens of years or be killed. Or maybe they’re outside of Russia, but they find they have a hard time talking about their feelings because, you know, who wants to hear about our feelings right now? Al Jazeera: How would you characterise Pussy Riot’s place within the history of political art of the past century? Tolokonnikova: Growing up, I really loved the Russian avant-garde movement – though that’s a very imperial phrase since many of its members were actually from Belarus or Ukraine. We have to come up with so many new terms. Russia has such a long way to go in decolonising itself, its history, its language. It’s pretty insane, and we’re just at the beginning of it. Anyway, I was really into [artists] like [Kazimir] Malevich, [Vladimir] Tatlin, [Vladimir] Mayakovsky. All of whom were men – they had women among them who were not that known at the time, unless they were lovers or wives. But then later feminist histories revealed that there were a lot of women in that movement. I always loved the avant-garde’s utopian vision for the world. Our godmothers are Valie Export, Judy Chicago, Marina Abramovic and Cindy Sherman. Guerrilla Girls, Riot grrrl, Jenny Holzer, Martha Rosler, Tracey Emin. We stand on the shoulders of these giants. Al Jazeera: And what do you think is next for you? Tolokonnikova: Well, I guess I’m hoping to not get poisoned or killed. Yeah.

       "  'Date': '2 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Top diplomats of the bloc gather in Kyiv in the first-ever meeting outside the EU borders in show of solidarity. The foreign ministers of all 27 European Union member states are meeting in war-torn Ukraine in their first-ever meeting outside the bloc’s borders, displaying support for Kyiv. The unannounced meeting takes place as the Ukrainian government pushes to join the EU in the future, amid Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which is in its 20th month. “I am convening today the EU Foreign Ministers in Kyiv, for the first-ever meeting of all 27 Member States outside the EU,” the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a post on social media platform X on Monday. “Ukraine’s future lies within the EU,” he added. Top officials from EU capitals have often visited Kyiv since the beginning of the war, but this is the first time an official EU summit is being held in the Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba hailed the ministers’ meeting “within future borders” of the EU in a post on social media platform X. “Glad to welcome EU foreign ministers at the historic meeting in Ukraine,” he said, adding: “For the first time in history, outside current EU borders. But also within its future borders.”      French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said the meeting was a signal to Moscow of the bloc’s determination to support Ukraine over the long term. “It is a demonstration of our resolute and lasting support for Ukraine, until it can win. It is also a message to Russia that it should not count on our weariness. We will be there for a long time to come,” she told reporters in Kyiv. The EU member states, along with the United Kingdom and the United States, have provided massive military and financial support to Ukraine, enabling it to stand up to the Russian offensive. Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from the Ukrainian city of Lubny, said the meeting symbolises a crucial moment in EU-Ukraine relations. “The Russian war in Ukraine is an existential threat not just to Ukraine, but to the European project,” he said. “The majority of EU countries speak in one voice when it comes to supporting Ukraine in this war,”\\xa0Basravi said. Monday’s meeting comes days after the US Congress blocked new aid for Ukraine in a government spending deal despite calls from the White House in the opposite direction. As uncertainty sets in over how long Kyiv’s allies will keep sending billions of dollars for the war, Kuleba said that Washington’s support for Ukraine was not weakening. “We do not feel that the US support has been shattered … because the United States understands that what is at stake in Ukraine is much bigger than just Ukraine,” he told reporters as he greeted Borrell for the summit. “The decision was taken as it was, but we are now working with both sides of the Congress to make sure that it does not repeat again under any circumstances,” Kuleba added. US President Joe Biden on Sunday reassured Kyiv and allies of continued financial support for the war effort despite the US Congress’s decision. He pressed congressional Republicans to back the aid, saying he was “sick and tired” of the political brinkmanship that had nearly closed the government down.

       "  'Date': '2 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Dozens pay respects in several Russian cities on a key date for mourning in the Eastern Orthodox church. Dozens of Russians from family to former fighters have held memorial services for Wagner mercenary group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin to mark 40 days since his death, hailing him as a hero of the people. Prigozhin was killed when his private jet crashed on its way from Moscow to St Petersburg on August 23, two months after he led a failed mutiny on Moscow. Two other top Wagner commanders, Prigozhin’s four bodyguards and the plane’s three crew were also killed in the still-unexplained crash.  At the 62-year-old’s grave in St Petersburg, his mother, Violetta, and his son, Pavel, laid flowers. Supporters waved the black flags of Wagner which sport a skull and the motto “Blood, Honour, Motherland, Courage”. In the Eastern Orthodox church, it is believed that the soul makes its final journey to either heaven or hell on the 40th day after death. Memorials also took place in Moscow and other Russian cities with dozens of Wagner fighters and everyday Russians paying their respects. There was no coverage on Russian state television or any official tributes. Wagner fighters have played a key role in the fighting in Ukraine, helping Russia capture the eastern town of Bakhmut in May after weeks of bruising battles. Wagner, whose troops were moved to camps in Belarus as part of a deal to end the mutiny, was also active in a number of African countries. “He can be criticised for certain events, but he was a patriot who defended the motherland’s interests on different continents,” Wagner’s recruitment arm said of Prigozhin in a statement on Telegram. “He was charismatic and importantly he was close to the fighters and to the people. And that’s why he became popular both in Russia and abroad.” Prigozhin’s mutiny, which followed months of expletive-laden videos insulting Russia’s top military officials, was arguably the biggest challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rule since the former KGB spy rose to power in 1999. The Wagner troops took over the southern city of Rostov, shot down several Russian aircraft and advanced towards Moscow before turning back 200 km (125 miles) from the capital following a purported deal brokered by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko. Mourners spoke of respect for Prigozhin, who got to know Putin while running a restaurant business in St Petersburg in the 1990s. He went on to win lucrative state catering contracts earning him the nickname, “Putin’s chef” and expanded into media as well as an infamous internet “troll factory” that led to his indictment in the United States for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Wagner brought him further into the limelight with the mercenary group developing a reputation for brutality and ruthlessness. “He was a real authority, a leader,” Mikhail, a soldier in Russia’s armed forces who refused to give his second name, told the Reuters news agency. Moscow resident Marta, who also refused to give her surname, said the people believed in Prigozhin but that Wagner had been “decapitated” by the deaths of him and co-founder Dmitry Utkin, a former special forces officer and a Nazi sympathiser. Prigozhin was also supposed to have moved to Belarus as part of the deal to end the mutiny. Russia looks set to continue using Wagner units despite the recent turmoil. On Friday, the Kremlin said Putin had told Andrei Troshev, one of Wagner’s top commanders, that he should “deal with forming volunteer units that could perform various combat tasks, primarily in the zone of the special military operation” – a term Moscow uses for its war in Ukraine.

       "  'Text': 'The US president reassures allies and Kyiv after a last-minute budget deal in Congress axes funding for the war-torn country. United States President Joe Biden says aid to Ukraine will keep flowing for now as he seeks to reassure allies of continued support for the war effort. But time is running out, the president said on Sunday in a warning to Congress, which has voted to avert a government shutdown by passing a short-term funding package that dropped assistance for Ukraine in the fight against Russia. “We cannot under any circumstances allow American support for Ukraine to be interrupted,” Biden said. “We have time, not much time and there is an overwhelming sense of urgency,” he said, noting that the funding bill lasts only until mid-November. Biden urged the Congress to negotiate an aid package as soon as possible. “The vast majority of both parties – Democrats and Republicans, Senate and House – support helping Ukraine and the brutal aggression that is being thrust upon them by Russia,” he said in an address from the White House. “Stop playing games. Get this done,” Biden said, adding that he expected Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to secure passage of a separate bill for Ukraine funding soon. “I want to assure our American allies, the American people and the people in Ukraine that you can count on our support. We will not walk away,” he said.      Despite Biden’s attempts to reassure Kyiv, the future of US aid for Ukraine hangs in the balance after a last-gasp deal to avoid a government shutdown. Although the compromise struck in Congress late on Sunday dropped new funding for Ukraine amid opposition from hardline Republicans, it remains unclear what might happen next. Biden and his Democratic party say the US has a duty to help Ukraine stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion, warning that failure to do so could embolden other nations in the future. But the issue has become so politicised in Washington that the fate of vital military aid is now in jeopardy, just as Kyiv tries to make progress in its sluggish counteroffensive before winter sets in. The US has been a major supporter of Ukraine after Russia invaded it last year, and Biden has sought to rally the world, as well as his own country, to maintain that support. Biden assured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a visit to Washington last month that strong US support for his war to repel Russian invaders would be maintained despite opposition from some Republican lawmakers. Biden urged Republicans to move ahead quickly to avoid another crisis in November. “The brinkmanship has to end. And there shouldn’t be another … crisis,” he said. “I strongly urge my Republican friends in Congress not to wait. Don’t waste time as you did all summer. Pass a year-long budget agreement. Honour the deal we made a few months ago.” Biden declined to weigh in on whether Democrats should support McCarthy if he needed their votes to keep his job as House speaker. The president said he would leave that to Democratic leaders in the Congress to decide. The US has approved four rounds of aid to Ukraine in response to Russia’s invasion, totaling about $113bn, with some of that money going towards replenishment of US military equipment that was sent to the front lines. In August, Biden called on Congress to provide for an additional $24bn.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '1 Oct 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Incentives available to partner with Ukrainian manufacturers as Kyiv looks to create ‘world class military products’. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced plans to expand the country’s domestic defence industry through partnerships with Western weapons manufacturers, in a bid to increase supplies for its counteroffensive against Russia. Speaking at the opening of the International Defence Industries Forum, Zelenskyy said he wanted to make Ukraine’s defence sector into a “large military hub” where military equipment and weapons could be built and repaired. “Ukraine is in such a phase of the defence marathon when it is very important, critical to go forward without retreating. Results from the front line are needed daily,” the president told executives representing more than 250 Western weapons producers. “We are interested in localising production of equipment needed for our defence and each of those advanced defence systems which are used by our soldiers, giving Ukraine the best results at the front today.” Zelenskyy said that air defence and de-mining were his immediate priorities. Ukraine also aims to boost domestic production of missiles, drones and artillery ammunition. The foreign ministry said Ukrainian producers had signed about 20 agreements with foreign partners for joint production, exchange of technology or supply of components to make drones, armoured vehicles and ammunition. It did not identify the companies. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who spoke by video link during the forum after visiting Kyiv earlier in the week, threw his weight behind the initiative. “Heroism alone cannot intercept missiles. Ukraine needs capabilities, high quality, high quantity, and quickly,” Stoltenberg said. “There is no defence without industry.” Ukraine retook the southern city of Kherson in November last year, and began a long-awaited counteroffensive in early June to try and recapture other territories seized by Russia, which launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022. Kyiv has reported advances in several directions and liberated more than a dozen villages since but Moscow still controls about 18 percent of Ukrainian territory. Ukraine’s allies have provided financial and military support worth tens of billions of dollars to help it push back Moscow’s forces. Ukrainian officials see the development of the country’s domestic defence industry as a potential boost to the economy, which shrunk by about a third last year as a result of the war. Several leading Western arms makers including Germany’s Rheinmetall and the United Kingdom’s BAE Systems have already announced plans to team up with Ukrainian producers. Ukraine will create new incentives to draw Western defence investment and establish a special fund, through dividends from state defence resources and profits from the sale of confiscated Russian assets, to support new technology development, officials said. “It will be a mutually beneficial partnership. I think it is a good time and place to create a large military hub,” Zelenskyy said during a separate meeting with weapons producers from the United States, the UK, Czechia, Germany, France, Sweden and Turkey. Recently appointed Defence Minister Rustem Umerov\\xa0said Kyiv had to do everything possible to produce all the necessary military services and products in Ukraine for the needs of its army. “Our vision is to develop world-class military products,” Umerov said.

       "  'Text': 'Moscow’s Ministry of Defence reports downing more than a dozen Ukrainian drones in latest attacks on Russian territory. A combat drone dropped explosives on an electricity substation in a Russian village near the border with Ukraine, while Russia’s Ministry of Defence reported shooting down more than a dozen Ukrainian drones over the Russian regions of Belgorod, Kursk and Kaluga. In the Russian village of Belaya, located less than 25km (16 miles) from the border, “a Ukrainian drone dropped two explosive devices on a substation”, Kursk regional governor Roman Starovoyt said on the Telegram messaging app early on Friday. “One of the transformers caught fire. Five settlements and a hospital were cut off from power supply. Fire crews rushed to the scene,” he said. “Power will be restored as soon as it is safe to do so.” Russian authorities said earlier that two Ukrainian drones were destroyed over the neighbouring Belgorod region. The Defence Ministry in Moscow said the first drone was “thwarted” at about 5pm local time (14:00 GMT) on Thursday. A second drone was brought down about four hours later.      Russia’s state-run TASS news agency later reported, citing Russia’s Defence Ministry, that 10 Ukrainian drones were brought down over the Kursk region overnight and one over the Kaluga region. Ukraine has intensified its attacks on Russian territory in recent weeks, with regions of the country now regularly subject to waves of Ukrainian drone attacks that have sporadically damaged buildings, including in Moscow. While Russian officials have downplayed their significance, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated this week that attacks on targets in Russia would increase. “We clearly see the areas where pressure on Russia needs to be increased so that terrorist capabilities do not grow,” he said in his nightly address on Tuesday. “Sanctions are not enough. There will be more. There will be more of our own – Ukrainian actions against the terrorist state. As long as Russia’s aggression continues, Russia’s losses must be tangible,” he said.

       "  'Text': 'Belarus has repeatedly accused the EU member of breaching its airspace. Warsaw denies the claims. Belarus has claimed that a Polish helicopter had violated its airspace as tensions are high between the two countries amid the conflict in Ukraine. “Around 1520 (1220 GMT), the aircraft crossed the border of the Republic of Belarus, flew to a depth of up to 1.5 km. At 1622, the helicopter repeatedly violated the state border, going 300 metres deep,” the Ministry of Defence of Belarus said on Thursday on its Telegram channel. Belarus, Russia’s closest ally, said it had scrambled military aircraft in response. The Polish army said the Belarusian claim was “false”. “Records made by flight control stations and radar stations confirm: such an event did not take place,” the army’s operational command said in a statement. “The Polish army respects and follows all provisions and regulations relating to the inviolability of borders.” Belarus has repeatedly accused the EU member of breaching its airspace. Warsaw has denied the claims. Belarus’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the Polish charge d’affaires, Marcin Wojciechowski, to protest. According to the ministry, Minsk has demanded Warsaw conduct “an objective investigation into the incident” and take measures to prevent such incidents in the future.

       "  'Date': '28 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': '‘The West is reliable, Russia is equally reliable,’ the Turkish president said in a recent interview, a comment that reflects his delicate balancing act. Kyiv, Ukraine – In Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s opinion, Russia and the West are “equally” reliable and trustworthy. That is what the Turkish president said on September 18 commenting on the collective West’s dependability and on his frustration with Turkey’s long-stalled attempts to join the European Union. “To the extent the West is reliable, Russia is equally reliable,” he told the PBS, a US broadcaster. “For the last 50 years, we have been waiting at the doorstep of the EU, and, at this moment in time, I trust Russia just as much as I trust the West.” After his September 4 visit to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin, Erdogan also believes the Kremlin’s master wants a prompt end to his faltering quagmire in Ukraine. “Mr Putin is on the side of ending this war as soon as possible. That’s what he said. And I believe his remarks,” Erdogan said. Erdogan may appear to sound naive, but he is directing a careful balancing act between the warring sides, the West, China and his own domestic audience. His equidistant position reaped enormous economic and political benefits both for him and his nation hobbled by a five years-long recession and traumatised by the February 6 earthquake that killed tens of thousands. “Erdogan’s geopolitics is based on balancing on three points of geopolitical confrontation – the West, Russia, China,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. “From every direction, Erdogan gets maximal profit – markets, technologies and the economic modernisation from the West, cheap raw materials, fuel and a natural gas hub from Russia, transit [of goods] and investments from China,” he said. To some Ukrainians, this balance may look cynical. “He’s like a market trader – he smiles and asks about your family, but all he wants is your money and your recommendation to another buyer,” Valentin Aleksashenko, a Kyiv-based IT analyst who regularly holidays in Turkey, told Al Jazeera. But Erdogan’s stance does help Kyiv’s war effort. He calls Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dear friend”, recently gave him a red-carpet reception in Istanbul, and has helped negotiate the release of war prisoners and the extension of the “grain deal” to ship Ukrainian wheat via the Black Sea. The Bayraktar attack drones produced by the company that belongs to Erdogan’s son-in-law proved to be so lethally effective against Russian troops that Ukrainians name radio stations, cell phone plans, and business lunch menus after them. Erdogan’s reluctance to take sides works for him at home – especially since his voters realise how reluctant most EU member states are to let their nation in, and how Western “double standards” on migration spur anti-Western sentiments among them, said Seda Demiralp of Istanbul’s Isik University. “His voters are convinced that an independent position benefits Turkish interests most. Turkish voters do appreciate closer ties with the West while at the same time realising Turkey is never treated as an equal partner by the West,” she told Al Jazeera. “From Erdogan’s point of view, it’s perfectly rational to pursue policies that are not seen as exclusively supporting one party. He can neither alienate the West nor Russia,” Gonul Tol, a Turkish-born analyst with the Middle East Institute, a think tank in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera. On the other hand, Brussels, Washington and Moscow have no choice but to approach Erdogan time and again.\\n“From Western and Russian points of view, no matter how frustrated they get with Erdogan, they, too, think they must cooperate with Turkey,” Tol said. And then there is a personal connection between Erdogan and Putin, whose political trajectories are somewhat similar. Both were born in the 1950s and have been in power for more than two decades pursuing what critics call\\xa0increasingly authoritarian and nationalist policies,\\xa0though Erdogan and his supporters deny this. Both are nostalgic about their nations’ imperial heyday – and strive to revive it despite all odds. And both try to find common ground. “Time has shown that both leaders follow their nations’ interests, but can agree and compromise at the same time,” said Emil Mustafayev, an analyst based in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, Turkey’s key ally in the former Soviet Union. “And despite their myriad disagreements, it makes their relationship somewhat unique in today’s world,” he told Al Jazeera. Both are rewriting the centuries-old history of very uneasy ties. Russian czars and Ottoman sultans were at war a dozen times, and Czar Nicolas I famously called Turkey “Europe’s sick man” before the Crimean war that pitted Turkey and Western powers against Russia in the 1850s. A century and a half later, Moscow looks like “Europe’s sick man” as its annexation of Crimea and the war in Ukraine prompted tensions between roughly the same players. In 2015, during Russia’s campaign to rescue Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s crumbling regime, Turkish air force downed a Russian fighter jet that Ankara claimed violated its air space. The incident provoked tensions as Moscow imposed sanctions, banned charter flights to Turkey and ordered holiday companies to “evacuate” tens of thousands of tourists. Gazprom, Russia’s natural gas exporter, suspended the construction of a 1,100-kilometers-long (683-mile) pipeline to Turkey. But tensions soon ended, Russian gas was pumped to Turkey and farther to Eastern Europe, and Moscow even allowed Ankara to defer a $600m gas bill. After the disruption of Nord Stream, a Russian natural gas pipeline to Germany, the Kremlin decided to create a “gas hub” in Turkey. But the plan stalled because of something that could be emblematic of ties between Erdogan and Putin – the sides cannot agree on who is going to have more control over the hub, Reuters reported in mid-September.

       "  'Text': 'Moscow says US, UK had role in planning and executing of attack by providing spy plane, satellite intelligence to Kyiv. Russia accused Ukraine’s Western allies of helping plan and execute a missile attack on the Russian Black Sea fleet’s headquarters in the annexed Crimean Peninsula last week. Moscow’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday that Western reconnaissance data, NATO country satellites and spy planes were all used in the attack carried out by Ukraine on the fleet’s headquarters. “There is no doubt that the attack had been planned in advance using Western intelligence means, NATO satellite assets and reconnaissance planes and was implemented upon the advice of [United States] and British security agencies and in close coordination with them,” Zakharova said at a briefing. “The obvious aim of such terrorist acts is to divert attention from the failed attempts of the counteroffensive by the Ukrainian armed forces and to frighten people, to stir up panic in our society,” she said. Moscow has repeatedly claimed that the US and its NATO allies have become involved in the war in Ukraine by supplying weapons to Kyiv and providing Ukrainian forces with intelligence information and helping plan attacks on Russian facilities. Unconfirmed news reports said Storm Shadow missiles, which have been provided to Ukraine by the United Kingdom and France, were used in the missile attack on the fleet’s headquarters in Sevastopol on Friday.      Zakharova’s criticism of the West followed comments made on Tuesday by Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, who said the arrival this week of US-made Abrams battle tanks in Ukraine and a promise by Washington to supply Kyiv with an unspecified number of long-range ATACMS missiles, would push NATO closer to a direct conflict with Russia. Friday’s missile attack on the Black Sea fleet’s headquarters in Sevastopol was just the latest against targets in the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Crimea has served as the key hub supporting the invasion of Ukraine and has increasingly come under fire by Ukrainian forces, who have promised to see the peninsula returned under Kyiv’s control. Ukraine said the missile strike put a large hole in the main building of the fleet’s headquarters and that 34 officers were killed, including the fleet’s commander Admiral Viktor Sokolov, and more than 100 Russian personnel were wounded. However, Sokolov was seen participating in a Russian defence officials’ meeting on Tuesday that was broadcast by Russian media.      On Wednesday, Russian state television stations also showed Sokolov purportedly speaking to journalists in Sevastopol after handing awards to a Black Sea fleet football team. Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said on Wednesday that while Russian media were at pains to “publish inconclusive ‘proof’” that the Black Sea fleet commander is still alive, the institute would reserve judgement until more is known. “ISW is unprepared at this time to make an assessment about the authenticity of the footage or the date of its filming,” the think tank said. “The Kremlin and Russian Ministry of Defense have been notably silent on the matter and have not directly confirmed that Sokolov is alive,” it added. Ukraine’s Special Operation Forces posted a statement on Tuesday saying its sources had claimed that Sokolov was among the dead from the missile strike and that it was trying to verify those reports after the video of Sokolov surfaced.

       "  'Text': 'Czech PM Petr Fiala says purchase of US-made F-35 fighter jets tells military allies ‘that they can count on us’. The Czech government has approved a plan to buy 24 US-made F-35 advanced fighter jets in a deal valued at approximately $6.5bn, the largest defence contract ever signed by the Czech Republic that will see the country significantly boost its military capabilities and integration with NATO. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala told reporters on Wednesday that the first of the supersonic stealth fighters would arrive by 2031 and the country’s military would have all 24 planes at its disposal by 2035. “The first F-35s will be ready in 2029 and our pilots will start training with them in the United States then,” Fiala said. Fiala said the F-35s “will solve the future of our tactical air forces for dozens of years to come”. “For our defence, it is important to boost our ties with NATO allies,” he said. In acquiring F-35s, “we are telling our allies that we take the defence of our country seriously and that they can count on us”, he said in a statement on social media.

State broadcaster Radio Prague International said the purchase of the F-35s “will be the biggest defence contract ever signed by [The Czech Republic]”. The US State Department approved the sale of F-35 jets, munitions and related equipment to the Czech Republic in June amid the country’s plans to replace 14 leased JAS-39 Gripen fighter jets from Sweden that are currently used by the Czech army. Czech Defence Minister Jana Cernochova said the state will pay 150 billion Czech crowns ($6.47bn) for the aircraft by 2034, a bill that includes the cost of the aircraft, training of pilots, ammunition, upgrades to the Caslav air force base in central Czech Republic and fuel. A member of the European Union and NATO with a population of some 10.5 million people, the Czech Republic has provided substantial military aid to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, including aircraft, tanks, howitzer artillery, armoured vehicles and ammunition.      In exchange for its military aid to Kyiv, Prague has received German-made Leopard tanks and financial compensation from the US and the EU. Chief of the general staff of the Czech armed forces Lieutenant General Karel Rehka said that the new jets would ensure “that in the case of need, we’ll manage to effectively defend ourselves against aggression, together with our allies”. The announcement of the F-35 deal comes as the Czech government plans to spend two percent of its gross domestic product on defence, in line with its NATO pledge. Produced by Lockheed Martin and equipped with anti-detection stealth technology, F-35s are used across NATO, but also by Australia, Japan, Israel and South Korea. Other countries including neutral Switzerland have also signed deals to buy the planes, which were launched in 2006.

The Czech army recently bought US-made Viper combat helicopters and Venom multi-purpose helicopters, replacing obsolete Russian-made Mi-24 helicopters, some of which it has sent to Ukraine.

       "  'Text': 'Canadian prime minister says ‘terrible mistake’ violated memory of all who suffered under Nazi regime. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has apologised after a man who served in a Nazi unit during World War II was honoured in Parliament, saying the “terrible mistake” harmed the memory of all those who suffered during the Holocaust. “On behalf of all those who were present in this chamber, I would like to offer my most sincere apologies for what happened on Friday,” Trudeau said in French in the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon. “Paying tribute to this individual, without knowing who he was, was a terrible mistake and a violation of the memory of those who cruelly suffered at the hands of the Nazi regime.” Yaroslav Hunka, 98, received two standing ovations in the House last week during a special session attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was in Ottawa to appeal for Canada’s continued support against Russia’s military offensive. Jewish community groups later reported that Hunka served in the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Nazi military unit during World War II, and they called for an explanation and an apology.      Trudeau on Wednesday also apologised to Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian delegation that travelled to Canada to take part in the parliamentary session, saying the incident has fuelled Russian “propaganda”. “It is extremely troubling to think that this egregious error is being politicised by Russia and its supporters to provide false propaganda about what Ukraine is fighting for,” the prime minister told reporters during a news conference before he spoke in Parliament. Russia, which launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine last year, has described the decision to honour Hunka as “outrageous”. “Many Western countries, including Canada, have raised a young generation that does not know who fought whom or what happened during the Second World War. And they know nothing about the threat of fascism,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov previously said. The Russian authorities have justified their continued assault on Ukraine as part of a push to “de-Nazify” the country. Kyiv and its allies have dismissed that, accusing Moscow of trying to conduct a land grab. Trudeau’s office and senior members of his Liberal Party government have said they had no advance knowledge of Hunka’s invitation to Parliament. The prime minister reiterated on Wednesday that the speaker of the House of Commons, Anthony Rota, was “solely responsible” for his recognition. “All of us who were in this House on Friday regret deeply having stood and clapped, even though we did so unaware of the context,” Trudeau said. Rota announced his resignation earlier this week — which he said would come into effect at the end of Wednesday — amid mounting pressure to step down over the incident. “I reiterate my profound regret for my error in recognising an individual in the House,” the speaker said on Tuesday. Still, Trudeau — who has seen his popularity drop in recent months — continues to be hammered by his political opponents, with the head of the opposition Conservative Party, Pierre Poilievre, accusing the prime minister of failing to adequately vet Hunka. “This is by far the biggest hit Canada’s diplomatic reputation has ever taken in its history, and it happened under Justin Trudeau’s government,” Poilievre said earlier on Wednesday. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the progressive New Democratic Party (NDP), also said that “real damage has been done — real damage to the Jewish community, real damage to the war effort in Ukraine and real damage to Canada’s reputation”. “What is [Trudeau] going to do in concrete terms to clean up this mess?” Singh asked in the House of Commons.

       "  'Date': '27 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Ukraine dealt a crippling blow to the Black Sea Fleet leadership, reportedly killing many of its officers during a planning meeting in their headquarters. Ukraine scored devastating deep strikes against Russian-occupied Crimea in the 83rd week of the war, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy toured Europe and the United States picking up pledges of new long-range weapons and financing. At the same time, Ukrainian and Western sources confirmed that Ukrainian troops had broken through the first and strongest line of Russian defence on the southern front, known as the Surovikin Line after the general who devised it. That success could accelerate their march towards the cities of Tokmak and Melitopol. Ukraine attacked three targets in occupied Crimea in as many days, honing its signature tactic of using a wave of drones to destroy or distract air defences, followed by a wave of missiles. Satellite images showed that attacks destroyed half of the Black Sea Fleet’s communications command centre in Verkhnosadove, 16 kilometres (10 miles) northeast of the fleet base in Sevastopol, on September 20. Aftermath of the Ukrainian strike at the Black Sea fleet command post near Sevastopol. Comparison of the @planet satellite imagery captured on Aug. 22 and Sep. 21. Russia claimed that all the rockets were intercepted, and the smoke seen on the video was caused by a burning grass. pic.twitter.com/p7jTlFv8U6 — Mark Krutov (@kromark) September 21, 2023  The following day Ukraine attacked the Saky airfield – the second time it has done so during the war. The Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne reported the attack caused “serious damage” and that 12 Russian combat aircraft were present, including Su-24 and Su-30 fighter-bombers. The most crippling attack came on September 22. Ukraine hit the Black Sea Fleet command headquarters and claimed to have killed 34 officers, including fleet commander Admiral Viktor Sokolov. A further 105 were reportedly wounded. One Sevastopol resident filmed the moment when the second missile struck. Russia’s defence ministry attempted to deny the attack, and later denied Sokolov was dead, circulating a video purporting to show him taking part in a teleconference on September 26. Ukraine’s military intelligence chief said the attack also seriously wounded the commander of Russian forces on the southern front, Colonel General Alexander Romanchuk. Russian occupation authorities said Ukraine targeted Sevastopol again the following day, but air defences neutralised the attack. Improved intelligence to “understand when the Russian leadership is getting together” was one reason for Ukraine’s success, Colonel Seth Krummrich, who has led special forces detachments in Afghanistan and the Middle East, and currently serves as vice president for Global Guardian, a security consultant, told Al Jazeera. The second was improved weapons systems from the West. Ukraine used Storm Shadow missiles provided by the United Kingdom and France. The political result was that “people are going to feel vulnerable,” said Krummrich. “You have a lot of wounded coming back to Russia who are disillusioned or resentful and you have a lot of people who are not coming back at all,” he said. “The truth is definitely on the Russian street … this is like radiation or toxicity, slowly building up in the population, and over time it could become lethal to a government.” Ukrainian knowledge of the terrain was also important, US special forces commander Dimitries Andrew Grimes told Al Jazeera. “They know the territory; they know where the targets are. They know Crimea and Sevastopol and how to achieve the effects they want to achieve,” he said. The attacks in Crimea coincided with a series of visits abroad by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, designed to pick up diplomatic, military and financial aid. The tactic apparently worked. US media, citing government sources, confirmed Washington would provide Army Tactical Missiles, or ATACMS, which Ukraine has been seeking. The 300km-range (186-mile) weapon has significantly greater reach than the 250km-range (155-mile) Storm Shadow missile, but independent weapons analyst Colby Badhwar said the ATACMS’ key advantage was speed. Storm Shadows are launched from aircraft, meaning a two-hour delay between identifying a target and striking it, allowing for time to mount the missiles and flying the aircraft within range of the target. “Ground launched ballistic missiles on the other hand, can be fired from a launcher already near the front line, and hit their target within a matter of minutes, thanks to their speed,” wrote Badhwar. “This responsiveness is critical for engaging Time Sensitive Targets.” These include missile launchers, aircraft and battlefield armour. ATACMS would also boost Ukraine’s thin inventory of sophisticated missiles. The Washington Post said the administration of US President Joe Biden was considering only the cluster version of ATACMS, but retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges said this was unsuitable for Ukraine because it has a shorter range than the single warhead version. It would “not [be] as effective at destroying large Russian facilities in Crimea,” he told Newsweek. “The [Biden] administration still seems to have a fear of providing long-range precision strike capability, which Ukraine might use against targets inside Russia,” Hodges said. Ukraine has been using only weapons of its own manufacture to hit Russia, and on September 24 it struck the Khalino Airfield near Kursk, reportedly killing aviation officers. Geolocated footage placed Ukrainian armoured vehicles behind the Russian first line of defence in Verbove, western Zaporizhia, on September 21. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, a think tank, said this was the first instance of Ukrainian forces operating beyond the tri-layered defence – part of what is known as the Surovikin Line. Two days later, Ukraine’s southern forces commander told CNN, “we have a breakthrough”, and the ISW confirmed the advance. “These fortifications are not the final defensive line in Russia’s defence in depth in western Zaporizhia Oblast, but rather a specific series of the best-prepared field fortifications arrayed as part of a near-contiguous belt of an anti-vehicle ditch, dragon’s teeth, and fighting positions about 1.7 – 3.5km (1.05-2.17 miles) west of Verbove,” the ISW said. Russian military reporters confirmed that Ukrainian units broke into Verbove itself on September 22. They also reported Ukrainian progress towards Novoprokopivka, in the same sector of the Zaporizhia region. According to one, Ukrainian forces were within 800 metres of the settlement. Ukraine’s success has not come easily. The ISW said Ukrainian forces were pinning down elements of three Russian divisions, and that additional elements of other divisions had been called forward from rear defence positions in Tokmak, 18km (11.2 miles) away from the front, to assist them. “It’s obvious the Russians are on the defensive right now,” said Grimes. “They’re operating with conscript forces because they’ve lost a lot of their élite forces, so they’re throwing their conscripts into the meat grinder.” Russian commanders have also ignored their own playbook, whereby “one echelon of Russian forces slows a Ukrainian tactical advance while a second echelon of forces counterattacks,” said the ISW. “Russian forces continue to expend significant combat power on counterattacking to hold their current positions and appear to be resisting the operationally sound course of action of falling back to prepared defensive positions further south,” it said. Some observers have said Ukraine risks losing global support because its advance has been slow. Krummrich believed Ukraine’s deliberative approach was key to its success. “When [countries] see Ukraine moving forward, that strengthens their righteous position on the world stage to say, ‘You need to back us’. If the Russians were blowing through Ukraine, a lot of midrange countries might say, ‘We’re going to hedge our bets on this.’”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '27 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Robert Fico’s win could raise the prospect of Slovakia dropping its staunch support of the war-torn country. Robert Fico, Slovakia’s three-time prime minister, has a chance to return to power in a closely fought early election on Saturday, raising the prospect of the central European country dropping its staunch support of neighbouring Ukraine. Fico’s SMER-SSD party has a narrow lead over liberal Progressive Slovakia (PS), which has pledged to\\xa0stay the course\\xa0on foreign policy, in two out of four\\xa0final\\xa0opinion\\xa0polls. Late voter shifts put PS a whisker ahead in the other two polls. A government led by Fico’s party could forge an alliance with Hungarian leader Viktor Orban, who has been an outlier on Ukraine and spars with the European Union over the rule of law. Such an alliance may be reinforced if Poland’s conservative PiS wins another term in October, although PiS has a hawkish view on Russia. The leading Slovak party is expected to get the first chance from liberal President Zuzana Caputova to form a cabinet. But who succeeds will depend on the results of half a dozen smaller parties as SMER-SSD and PS will fall short of a majority and need several allies in the 150-seat parliament. The third-largest party and possible kingmaker is the moderate-left Hlas (Voice) of Peter Pellegrini, a former member of SMER-SSD and prime minister in 2018-20. He has kept his options open but is seen closer to Fico. Fico, 59, resigned in 2018 after protests against corruption following the murder of an investigative journalist. He adopted more pro-Russian views, amplified by disinformation on social networks, in opposition to a centre-right coalition that ruled the country from 2020. That coalition fell apart last year and was replaced by a caretaker cabinet. Fico has pledged to end\\xa0military aid\\xa0to Ukraine, a sharp U-turn from Slovakia’s current position as a supplier of heavy equipment to its eastern neighbour. “We refuse statements and positions that state that the current Russia-Ukraine conflict is our conflict as well,” Fico told the Reuters news agency in an email. Political analyst Grigorij Meseznikov said that, despite fiery rhetoric, Fico had a record of avoiding unnecessary clashes with Brussels or NATO allies, but having Orban as an ally would embolden him. “Orban has managed to at least complicate adopting [Russia] sanctions packages … Fico will be doing the same,” he said. “They will support each other.” “He will stop the weapons [for Ukraine], that is what he gains support on.” Fico has criticised migrants being allowed through Slovakia and said in a Tuesday television debate he would immediately impose controls on the border with Hungary. Fico’s policies would depend on what coalition SMER-SSD could form. Potential partners range from Hlas to the far-right Republika, which foreign diplomats said would be a red line for Slovakia’s allies. Centrist liberal voters have flocked to the nonparliamentary PS, led by Oxford political science graduate and European Parliament Vice-Chairman Michal Simecka, 39. PS has ruled out working with extremists or with Fico. The party has run a strongly pro-European campaign and would be closer within central Europe to the Czech Republic. It is open to working with small conservative parties, though any such alliance could be unstable due to ideological differences. Fico faced criminal charges in 2022 of using sensitive information on political opponents. The charges, which he denied, have been dropped, though the investigation continues. Fico has sought the removal of the country’s special prosecutor dealing with high-level corruption cases. Any such steps would be closely watched by Brussels, which could withhold EU subsidies – as it has in rows with Poland and Hungary – if it deems they go against rule of law, an EU diplomat told Reuters.

       "  'Date': '26 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': \"Anthony Rota resigns in face of mounting pressure after he honoured a man who served in Nazi World War II unit. The speaker of Canada’s Parliament has stepped down, days after he honoured a man who fought in a Nazi unit during World War II as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the House of Commons last week. Addressing Canadian lawmakers in Ottawa on Tuesday afternoon, Speaker Anthony Rota said he was resigning “with a heavy heart”. “This House is above any of us. Therefore, I must step down as your speaker,” said Rota, who invited Yaroslav Hunka to Friday’s special parliamentary session in the House of Commons, where he recognised the 98-year-old as a “Ukrainian hero”. Hunka served in the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the Nazi’s SS military unit, said the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish community group. He received standing ovations in the House of Commons, including from Zelenskyy and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who were in attendance. “I reiterate my profound regret for my error in recognising an individual in the House,” Rota said in Parliament on Tuesday afternoon, as he faced mounting calls to resign from advocacy groups, Canadian lawmakers and even top members of his own Liberal Party. “That public recognition has caused pain to individuals and communities, including the Jewish community in Canada and around the world, in addition to survivors of Nazi atrocities in Poland, among other nations,” he said. His resignation will come into effect at the end of the day on Wednesday, Rota added.      Canadian legislators from all major parties had called for Rota to step down, with Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly telling reporters on Tuesday morning that the episode was “an embarrassment to the House and to Canadians”. “And I think the speaker should listen to members of the House and step down,” she said. The progressive New Democratic Party’s House leader, Peter Julian, said earlier this week that Rota had made “an unforgivable error that puts the entire House in disrepute”. Asked about his resignation on Tuesday afternoon, Julian told reporters that steps need to be taken “to ensure that this never happens again in a Canadian Parliament”. He added that it remained unclear when a vote on the next speaker would take place. The speaker of the House of Commons is elected by fellow parliament members to preside over the proceedings in the chamber. The episode came as Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, on Friday addressed Canadian parliamentarians for the second time since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of his country in February of last year. The Russian authorities justified their continued assault on Ukraine as part of a push to “de-Nazify” the country. Kyiv and its allies have dismissed that as Russian propaganda, accusing Moscow of trying to conduct a land grab. I'm glad the Speaker of the House of Commons quickly apologized and took responsibility for this mistake, but it was so egregious – so injurious to Canada, our Parliament and our Ukrainian partners, and so offensive to Jews everywhere – he needs to resign. https://t.co/8gENJMQpbx — Roland Paris (@rolandparis) September 25, 2023  Russia said it was “outrageous” that Hunka was honoured in Canada. “Such sloppiness of memory is outrageous,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “Many Western countries, including Canada, have raised a young generation that does not know who fought whom or what happened during the second world war. And they know nothing about the threat of fascism.” Roland Paris, director of the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa, said earlier this week that while Rota’s quick apology was welcomed, it did not go far enough. “It was so egregious – so injurious to Canada, our Parliament and our Ukrainian partners, and so offensive to Jews everywhere – he needs to resign,” Paris wrote on social media. Trudeau, who described the events as “deeply embarrassing” for Canada, also has faced questions from opposition Conservative Party lawmakers over what he knew about Hunka’s background and how he was vetted. Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, earlier on Tuesday accused the prime minister of failing “to have his massive diplomatic and intelligence apparatus vet and prevent honouring a Nazi”.

       "  'Date': '26 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Viktor Solokov, Moscow’s top admiral in Crimea, was shown in a Russian defence ministry video conference after allegedly being killed in a weekend missile attack. Viktor Sokolov, commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in Crimea, has been shown attending a meeting a day after Ukrainian special forces claimed he died in a barrage of missiles. In video and photographs released by the Russian defence ministry and shown on state television on Tuesday, Sokolov is seen taking part in a video conference with Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu and other top admirals and army chiefs. Ukraine’s special forces said on Monday that Sokolov was killed in the Russian-annexed peninsula along with 33 other officers in a missile attack on the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in the port of Sevastopol. The statement added 105 others were wounded in the strikes. While the report did not name Sokolov, Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, posted the admiral’s name and a photo on social media. The defence ministry released a statement saying the meeting had taken place earlier in the day. Sokolov appears on screen several times without speaking. Russia has suffered a string of attacks on the strategically important port of Sevastopol in recent months. Sokolov was appointed commander of the Black Sea Fleet in September 2022. According to media reports, his predecessor was removed after Ukraine’s sinking of the missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a few months after Moscow’s full-scale war against Ukraine began. Earlier on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the Ukrainian claim about Sokolov’s demise, referring reporters to the defence ministry. In the video released by the ministry, Shoigu said more than 17,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in September and 2,700 weapons, including seven American Bradley fighting vehicles, were destroyed. “The Ukrainian armed forces are suffering serious losses along the entire front line,” Shoigu said, adding the Ukrainian counteroffensive had so far produced no results. “The United States and its allies continue to arm the armed forces of Ukraine, and the Kyiv regime throws untrained soldiers to their slaughter in senseless assaults,” Shoigu said.      Ukraine’s counteroffensive has yet to yield significant territorial gains against Russian forces, which control about 17.5 percent of the internationally recognised territory of Ukraine. According to a September 19 scorecard by the Belfer Center at Harvard’s Kennedy School, Russia has gained 90 sq km (35 square miles) of territory from Ukraine in the past month while Ukrainian forces have taken 41 sq km (16 square miles) from Russian forces. Kyiv has stepped up attacks in the Black Sea and on the Crimean Peninsula as its forces press on with the nearly four-month-old counteroffensive to take back Russian-occupied territory. Russian territory, including the capital Moscow, has been subject to numerous drone attacks in recent months.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '25 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Some rhetoric disseminated by Russian media could amount to incitement to genocide, the Human Rights Council probe says. UN investigators probing violations in Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion have warned that some rhetoric transmitted by Russian media could amount to incitement to genocide. Speaking before the UN Human Rights Council on Monday, the head of the investigation team, Erik Mose, voiced concern “about allegations of genocide in Ukraine”. “For instance, some of the rhetoric transmitted in Russian state and other media may constitute incitement to genocide,” he said, adding that the team was “continuing its investigations on such issues”. The Norwegian judge heads a three-person Commission of Inquiry (COI), which was created by the council to investigate violations committed since Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February last year. In its first full report in March, the team determined that Russian authorities had committed “a wide range of war crimes”. Mose said at the time that the commission was aware of accusations of genocide, including the forced transfer of Ukrainian children to areas under Russian control, and promised to investigate.      In his update to the council on Monday, Mose lamented a “lack of clarity and transparency on the full extent, circumstances, and categories of children transferred”, and said the team was continuing to investigate. “Whether that will also raise issues of genocide will then be clarified in the course of our investigations,” he told reporters. The March report had also determined that Moscow was behind a vast array of other war crimes, including widespread attacks on civilians and infrastructure, killings, torture and rape and other sexual violence. Mose said on Monday that the commission, which had travelled more than 10 times to Ukraine, was now “undertaking a more in-depth investigation” that “may also clarify whether torture and attacks on energy infrastructure amount to crimes against humanity”. Among other things, he said the team was investigating the cause of the disastrous destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in Russian-held territory on June 6. The team had also collected more evidence indicating “widespread and systematic” use of torture by Russian armed forces, commission member Pablo de Greiff told reporters. The torture was mainly taking place in detention centres controlled by Russian authorities, and was in some cases so brutal the victims died, he said. “Not having access to places of detention under the control of the Russian Federation, it is impossible to quantify exactly the number of people that may have died as a result of this practice,” he said, adding that it appeared to be “a fairly large number”. Rape and other sexual violence was also widespread. In the Kherson region, the commission found that “Russian soldiers raped and committed sexual violence against women of ages ranging from 19 to 83 years”, Mose said. Pointing to “the scale and gravity of violations and corresponding crimes that have been committed in Ukraine by Russian armed forces”, he emphasised “the need for accountability”. The investigators are in the process of drawing up a list of suspected perpetrators, which “will be in due course submitted to the High Commissioner for Human Rights”, he said. The team, he said, has also urged Ukrainian authorities to ” expeditiously and thoroughly investigate the few cases of violations by its own forces”. The cases of abuse found on the Ukrainian side largely involved the use of explosive weapons that affected civilian populations and the mistreatment of detained Russian soldiers, the investigators said. But Mose stressed that there was no comparison to the variety and vast numbers of violations committed on the Russian side.               Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Canadian parliament’s speaker says ‘deeply sorry’ for honouring Yaroslav Hunka, 98, during Zelenskyy visit to Ottawa. The speaker of Canada’s House of Commons has apologised for praising an individual who served in a Nazi unit during World War II in a session attended by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Speaker Anthony Rota recognised Yaroslav Hunka, 98, as a “Ukrainian hero, a Canadian hero” before the Canadian Parliament on Friday, saying “we thank him for all his service”. Hunka served in World War II as a member of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, according to the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights group, that demanded an apology. The centre said Hunka’s ties to the Nazi war machine “are well-documented”. Both Zelenskyy and Trudeau joined in acknowledging Hunka during the parliament session with applause. Rota took responsibility for what he characterised as an oversight, calling the initiative “entirely my own”. “I have subsequently become aware of more information which causes me to regret my decision,” he said in a statement on Sunday, offering his “deepest apologies to Jewish communities in Canada and around the world”. He reiterated his apology on Monday in Parliament, telling Canadian lawmakers that he was “deeply sorry” for his gesture and remarks. “I would also like to add that this initiative was entirely my own,” Rota said. “No one, including you – my fellow parliamentarians – or the Ukraine delegation was privy to my remarks prior to their delivery.” The recognition came following the visit to parliament by Zelenskyy, who thanked Canada for its assistance in Ukraine’s war against Russia. Following Zelenskyy’s remarks, Rota acknowledged Hunka – who was seated in the gallery – praising him for fighting for Ukrainian independence against the Russians. Hunka received two standing ovations from those gathered. As Canadian lawmakers cheered, Zelenskyy raised his fist in acknowledgement and Hunka saluted. “At a time of rising anti-Semitism and Holocaust distortion, it is incredibly disturbing to see Canada’s parliament rise to applaud an individual who was a member of a unit in the Waffen-SS – a Nazi military branch responsible for the murder of Jews and others,” the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center said in a statement. “An explanation must be provided as to how this individual entered the hallowed halls of Canadian parliament and received recognition from the Speaker of the House and a standing ovation.” Russia’s RIA state news agency cited Russia’s ambassador to Canada, Oleg Stepanov, as saying the embassy will send a letter to Trudeau and a note to the Canadian foreign ministry on Monday. “We will, of course, demand clarification from the Canadian government,” Stepanov was quoted as saying. Dominique Arel, chair of Ukrainian studies at the University of Ottawa, said the incident “is highly problematic”. “We have the issue of symbolism here, the optics of serving in a military unit whose logo is that of arguably the greatest criminal organisation in the 20th century … so obviously the optics are not good,” Arel told CBC News. Trudeau in particular has come under pressure from opposition Conservative lawmakers, who have questioned how the Canadian prime minister’s office could have been unaware of Hunka’s background. “Your statement doesn’t answer the questions around how this individual was vetted,” Andrew Scheer, the former Conservative Party leader, told Rota in the House of Commons on Monday. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, saying the goal of the “special military operation” was to denazify and demilitarise its neighbour.\\xa0Zelenskyy is Jewish and lost relatives in the Holocaust. Kyiv and its Western allies say Russia’s attack, which has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions, has been an unprovoked land grab. The United States says Moscow’s false justification for the war has been nothing but the Kremlin’s attempt to “manipulate international public opinion”. B’nai Brith Canada’s CEO Michael Mostyn said it was outrageous that parliament honoured a former member of a Nazi unit. Mostyn said Ukrainian “ultranationalist ideologues” who volunteered for the Galicia Division “dreamed of an ethnically homogenous Ukrainian state and endorsed the idea of ethnic cleansing”. “We understand an apology is forthcoming. We expect a meaningful apology. Parliament owes an apology to all Canadians for this outrage, and a detailed explanation as to how this could possibly have taken place at the centre of Canadian democracy,” Mostyn said.

       "  'Text': 'Russia’s foreign minister glosses over Ukraine, accuses Western allies of neo-colonialism at the UN General Assembly. Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has called the West an “empire of lies” and accused it of adopting a neo-colonial mindset in its overtures to the Global South to win backing for Ukraine in the war. Speaking after a week of intense global diplomacy at the annual gathering of world leaders at UN headquarters in New York, where Ukraine and its Western allies sought to drum up support for Kyiv as it fights against Russia’s invasion, Lavrov said a “global majority” was being duped by the West. “The US and its subordinated collective continue to fuel conflicts which artificially divide humanity into hostile blocks and hamper the achievement of overall aims,” Lavrov said. “They are trying to force the world to play according to their own self-centred rules.” James Bays, Al Jazeera’s diplomatic correspondent, said Lavrov’s speech was part of a “tour around the world of Russia’s views” that contained no real mention of Ukraine and few indications of Moscow’s plan one year into the conflict. During a news conference following the speech, the foreign minister dismissed a 10-point proposal put forward by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as the latest UN proposals to revive the Black Sea grain initiative. “It is completely not feasible,” he said of the peace blueprint promoted by Kyiv. “It is not possible to implement this. It’s not realistic and everybody understands this, but at the same time, they say this is the only basis for negotiations.” He also said the UN proposal would not fly because the West did not deliver on its promises to Moscow, including removing sanctions on a Russian bank and reconnecting it to the global SWIFT system. The February 2022 invasion of Ukraine triggered trade disruptions and significant increases in international prices for energy, agricultural commodities, and fertiliser, which were already elevated due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Russia’s foreign minister placed the blame for the crises in the food and energy markets on Western nations, who impose “unilateral coercive measures” – or sanctions – on weaker ones.      Lavrov’s speech came as Zelenskyy awarded two Polish volunteers state awards during a stopover, as relations between the two countries are strained over grain imports. He did not meet with any officials. Zelenskyy angered his neighbours when he told the UN General Assembly that Kyiv was working to preserve land routes for grain exports, but that the “political theatre” around imports was only helping Moscow. Poland decided last week to extend a ban on Ukrainian grain imports, shaking Kyiv’s relationship with a neighbour that has been one of its staunchest allies since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. Zelenskyy thanked all Poles who “from the first days opened their families, their homes, opened themselves up and helped”. “I believe that any challenges on our common path are nothing compared to the fact that there is such strength between our people,” he said. Continuing fighting Ukraine is continuing a counteroffensive to repel the Russian invasion and recapture its lost territories. On Saturday morning, it launched another missile attack on Sevastopol on the occupied Crimean Peninsula, a day after an attack on the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet that left a serviceman missing and the main building smouldering. Ukraine’s intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, told Voice of America on Saturday that at least nine people were killed and 16 others wounded as a result of Kyiv’s attack on the Black Sea Fleet on Friday. Budanov claimed Alexander Romanchuk, a Russian general commanding forces along the key southeastern front line, was “in a very serious condition” following the attack. Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from Kyiv, said Ukraine’s military intelligence confirmed the death toll. At least two senior generals were wounded, while the fate of the head of the Russian Black Sea navy, Viktor Sokolov, remained unknown. Russia did not confirm the number of casualties. Crimea has served as the key hub supporting Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Sevastopol, the main base of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet since the 19th century, has had a particular importance for navy operations since the start of the war. Hanna Shelest, a security analyst with the Ukrainian Prism NGO, said Kyiv’s attacks on Crimea were important for its strategy and morale. The majority of the attacks on Ukraine’s southern region come from Crimea, and moves to diminish the capabilities there have strategic importance, Shelest told Al Jazeera. Ukraine’s military said the air force conducted 12 attacks on the Black Sea Fleet headquarters on Friday, targeting areas where personnel, military equipment and weapons were concentrated. It said that two anti-aircraft missile systems and four Russian artillery units were hit. Ukraine has increasingly targeted naval facilities in Crimea in recent weeks while the brunt of its counteroffensive makes slow gains in the east and south of Ukraine.

       "  'Date': 'No Date',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Investigators from Germany, Sweden and Denmark remain tight-lipped while speculation and theories abound. A year has passed since explosions rocked the Nord Stream pipelines, cutting off a major route for Russian gas exports to Europe and fuelling geopolitical tensions already at a fever pitch after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. However, despite official investigations in three countries, the question of who is responsible for the act of sabotage remains unanswered. Without hard evidence, many theories have emerged pointing the finger at Ukraine, Russia or the United States, all of which have denied involvement. Here is what we know about the Nord Stream attack: On September 26, 2022, several underwater blasts ruptured three of the four pipelines comprising Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, spewing vast amounts of gas into the Baltic Sea near Bornholm, Denmark. Russian energy giant Gazprom halted flows through Nord Stream 1, the main conduit for Russian natural gas to Germany, amid disputes over the war in Ukraine a month earlier. The newly completed Nord Stream 2 twin pipelines never opened as Berlin pulled the plug on the project days before Russian troops entered Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The 10-billion-euro ($10.6bn) Nord Stream 2 had long been opposed by Ukraine, the US and Eastern European countries which feared it would give Russia too much influence over Germany’s energy security. The blasts occurred in the economic zones of Sweden and Denmark, so both countries launched investigations into the incident. So far, they say the explosions were deliberate, but they have yet to single out who was behind the blasts. Germany also launched an investigation with federal prosecutors searching a yacht in January that might have been used to transport the explosives. They seized objects from the vessel and found traces of explosives. They have refused to comment on media speculation that a team of five men and one woman chartered the Andromeda yacht from Rostock port to carry out the operation. “The identity of the perpetrators and their motives” remains the subject of ongoing investigations, Germany’s prosecution office told AFP news agency. The fact all three countries have kept a tight lid on their investigations is unsurprising, according to analysts, given the potential diplomatic fallout of what they might uncover. Investigative journalists have been carrying out their own research to solve the Nord Stream whodunnit, leading to sometimes sensational, if unconfirmed, reports. Dutch military intelligence warned the CIA of a Ukrainian plan to blow up the pipelines three months before the attack, Dutch broadcaster NOS and Germany’s Die Zeit and ARD reported in June. The Washington Post made a similar claim. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly denied his country was behind the sabotage. “I would never do that,” he told Germany’s Bild newspaper, adding he would “like to see proof”. In March, The New York Times wrote that US officials had seen intelligence indicating a “pro-Ukrainian group” was responsible, without Zelenskyy’s knowledge. German media have focused on the Andromeda, with reporters from Der Spiegel magazine and broadcaster ZDF recreating the journey they believe was made by the six-person crew. According to their reporting, a forged passport used to hire the sailboat leads back to a Ukrainian soldier, while the charter fee was paid by a company registered in Poland with ties to a woman in Kyiv. In June, The Wall Street Journal reported Germany was trying to match DNA samples found on the vessel “to at least one Ukrainian soldier”. The Journal also said evidence found in the investigation included data from Andromeda’s radio and navigation equipment, satellite and mobile phones, and Gmail accounts allegedly used by the perpetrators. Danish media have reported a Russian naval vessel specialised in submarine operations, the SS-750, was photographed near the site of the blasts days before the attack. US investigative journalist Seymour Hersh reported in February the US was behind the blasts and that Norway assisted. It was dismissed as “fiction” by the White House. Experts have not ruled out a “false flag” operation by Russia, with clues deliberately placed to pin the blame on Ukraine. Andreas Umland, an analyst at the Stockholm Centre for Eastern European Studies, said he sees Russia as “the most likely” culprit. Any suspected involvement by Kyiv in an attack on Europe’s energy infrastructure could threaten the support of allies, which would benefit Russia. At the same time, the destroyed pipelines could help Gazprom avoid compensation claims for undelivered gas, even though the company was reluctant to keep the taps open before the blasts. Moscow may have sought “to kill two birds with one stone”, Umland said. The Kremlin has strongly denied responsibility. Russia has alleged the US was behind the attack, noting the sabotage “occurred after the repeated threats\\xa0to the Nord Stream by the leadership of the United States”. In March, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the argument that Kyiv was behind the explosions, instead laying blame on the US. “Who is interested? Theoretically, the United States is interested in stopping the supply of Russian energy to the European market and supplying volumes of its own,” he told an interviewer. “Such an explosion, so powerful and at such depth, could only be conducted by experts backed by the entire potential of a state that has relevant technologies,” said Putin.

       "  'Text': \"Ukrainian President Zelenskyy did not respond directly to a question about the US supplying long-range missile system. United States President Joe Biden has informed his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that Washington will provide Kyiv with ATACMS long-range missiles, US broadcaster NBC News has reported. Ukraine has repeatedly asked the Biden administration for the long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to help hit supply lines, airbases and rail networks deep behind Russia’s front lines in occupied regions of Ukraine. But the White House has not announced a decision to provide Ukraine with the ATACMS system and the missiles were not publicly discussed when Zelenskyy visited Washington, DC on Thursday for talks with Biden, even as the US announced a new $325m military aid package for Kyiv. The White House and the Pentagon declined to comment on the NBC report on Friday. The Pentagon also declined to say whether any promise of ATACMS was given to Zelenskyy during his meetings on Thursday at the Department of Defense, saying: “In regards to ATACMS, we have nothing to announce.” A date for delivery of the ATACMS was not revealed, according to NBC. Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned earlier this month that the supply of longer-range missiles to Kyiv would cross a “red line” and the US would be viewed as “a party to the conflict” in Ukraine if it did provide such weapons. Zelenskyy did not answer directly when asked about the NBC reports on ATACMS, but he noted that the US was the biggest single supplier of weaponry to Ukraine. “We are discussing all the different types of weapons – long-range weapons and artillery, artillery shells with the calibre of 155mm, then air defence systems,” Zelenskyy said, speaking through an interpreter.

The Washington Post also reported that the US plans to provide Ukraine with a version of the ATACMS that will be armed with cluster bomblets rather than a single warhead, citing several unnamed sources familiar with the deliberations, and that can fly up to 306km (190 miles). ATACMS is designed for “deep attack of enemy second-echelon forces”, a US Army website states, and could be used to attack command and control centres, air defences and logistics sites well behind the front line.

       "  'Date': '23 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Poland’s PM Mateusz Morawiecki accused the Ukrainian leader of insulting Poles in his United Nations address this week. Poland’s prime minister has told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to never “insult” Poles again, returning to harsh rhetoric towards Kyiv after the Polish president had sought to defuse a simmering dispute between the two countries over the issue of Ukrainian grain imports. Zelenskyy angered his neighbours in Warsaw – a key military ally against Russia – when he told the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week that Kyiv was working to preserve land routes for its grain exports amid a Russian blockade of the Black Sea, but that “political theatre” around grain imports was helping Moscow’s cause. Poland extended a ban last week on Ukrainian grain imports in a unilateral move that broke with a European Union ruling. The move has shaken Kyiv’s relationship with Warsaw, which has been seen as one of its staunchest allies since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. “I … want to tell President Zelenskyy never to insult Poles again, as he did recently during his speech at the UN,” Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told an election rally on Friday, according to the State-run news agency PAP.      Earlier on Friday, Poland’s President Andrzej Duda said the dispute between Poland and Ukraine over grain imports would not significantly affect good bilateral relations, in an apparent move to ease tensions. “I have no doubt that the dispute over the supply of grain from Ukraine to the Polish market is an absolute fragment of the entire Polish-Ukrainian relations,” Duda told a business conference. “I don’t believe that it can have a significant impact on them, so we need to solve this matter between us.” Duda’s comment followed after Prime Minister Morawiecki was reported as saying that Poland would no longer send weapons to Ukraine amid the grain dispute. “We are no longer transferring weapons to Ukraine because we are now arming Poland with more modern weapons,” Morawiecki said on Wednesday, according to a local media report.      Poland is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections on October 15, and Morawiecki’s ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party has come in for criticism from the far right for what it says is the government’s subservient attitude to Kyiv. Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau said in an article by Politico that Poland wanted to see “a strong Ukrainian state emerge from this war with a vibrant economy”, and that Warsaw “will continue to back Ukraine’s efforts to join NATO and the EU”. However, speaking to reporters in New York, Rau said that while Poland had not changed its policy towards Ukraine, there had been a “radical change in Polish public opinion’s perception” of the countries’ relationship. Asked by the PAP news agency what it would take to improve this perception, Rau said repairing the atmosphere would require a “titanic” diplomatic effort. Slovakia, Poland and Hungary imposed national restrictions on Ukrainian grain imports after the EU executive decided not to extend its ban on imports into those countries as well as fellow EU members Bulgaria and Romania.      The countries have argued that cheap Ukrainian agricultural goods – meant mainly to transit further west and to ports – get sold locally, harming their own farmers. Speaking in Canada on Friday, Zelenskyy did not mention the tension with Poland but said that when Ukraine lacked support, Russia was strengthened. “You help either Ukraine or Russia. There will be no mediators in this war. By weakening assistance to Ukraine, you will strengthen Russia,” Zelenskyy told reporters after a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “And a powerful Russia and what to expect from it… I think history in books and witnesses has long since answered this question. If someone wants to take a risk, fine, weaken assistance to Ukrainians,” he said, according to a statement posted on the Ukrainian president’s website. “To be frank and honest, freedom, democracy and human rights must be fought for,” he added. The Kremlin said on Friday that it was watching the situation between Kyiv and Warsaw closely, adding that tensions would inevitably grow between Kyiv and its European allies as the dispute over grain escalates. “We predict that these frictions between Warsaw and Kyiv will increase. Friction between Kyiv and other European capitals will also grow over time. This is inevitable,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “We are, of course, watching this closely,” Peskov said, calling Kyiv and Warsaw “the main” centres of Russophobia.      \\xa0          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '22 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joins Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for a historic second parliamentary address. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has issued a forceful rebuke to Russian “genocide” from the floor of Canada’s Parliament, as he continues to rally support for his war-torn country. “Moscow — now, as always — is bent on controlling Ukraine and makes use of all available means to do that, including genocide,” he told a packed House of Commons in Ottawa on Friday. “It is genocide, what Russian occupiers are doing to Ukraine,” he said. “And when we want to win, when we call on the world to support us, it is not just about an ordinary conflict. It is about saving [the] lives of millions of people.” Zelenskyy’s fiery speech, delivered in English, marks his latest appeal to world leaders as he completes a whirlwind tour of North America, which began earlier this week with an appearance at the United Nations in New York. But the Ukrainian leader’s warm reception in Canada marked a stark contrast to what he experienced a day before, when he visited the US legislature in Washington, DC. There, Zelenskyy faced a Republican Party more vocal about curtailing support for Ukraine, as the deadline to pass budget legislation looms, with just over a week remaining. The Ukrainian president’s request to speak before a joint session of the US Congress was also declined, with House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy telling reporters, “We just didn’t have the time.” In Canada, however, leaders gave the Ukrainian president the rare honour of delivering a second address before Parliament. He had previously spoken to the legislature via video in March 2022, just weeks after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of his country. Few other world leaders have had the opportunity to speak twice before Canada’s Parliament. They include such notable figures as South Africa’s Nelson Mandela, the UK’s Margaret Thatcher and US Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced Zelenskyy on Friday with remarks that included a pledge for increased aid to Ukraine. “Canada has provided nearly nine billion [Canadian] dollars in military, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine since Putin began his war of aggression,” Trudeau said. “We are making a longer-term, multiyear commitment that provides predictable steady support to Ukraine. It will include 650 million [Canadian] dollars over three years for 50 armoured vehicles, including medical evacuation vehicles that will be built by Canadian workers in London, Ontario.” Trudeau also announced funding for mental health initiatives helmed by Ukraine’s First Lady Olena Zelenska, saying, “The toll of this war on the mental health and wellbeing of Ukrainians is immeasurable.” Zelenska was in the audience, along with Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov and the family of a Canadian volunteer, Antony Ihnat, who was killed earlier this month during a Russian missile attack in Ukraine. While much of the focus was on Russian aggression, Trudeau took a swipe at China as well in his introductory remarks, mentioning its detention and release of two Canadian citizens: Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. “There are countries that are bending or breaking the rules,” Trudeau said. “In this era of uncertainty and resurgent great-power competition, rules are what will protect us. And it’s not enough for them to be written down somewhere. We must advocate for them, stand up for them and live by them. History will judge us on how we defend democratic values.” He called Ukraine “the tip of the spear” in that fight. For his part, Zelenskyy began his speech by recognising a monument in Edmonton, Alberta, that honours the victims of the Holodomor, sometimes called the Ukrainian Famine of 1932. Canada recognises the Holodomor as a genocide designed “to systematically destroy the Ukrainian people’s aspirations for a free and independent Ukraine”. Erected in 1983, the Edmonton memorial was one of the first to commemorate the famine, even while Ukraine remained under Soviet rule. “At that time, Ukraine didn’t yet have memorials commemorating the victims of genocide of Ukrainians because Ukraine was under Moscow’s control back then,” Zelenskyy said. A lot has changed since that time, the Ukrainian president added, but not the violence perpetrated by Russia. “This Russian aggression must end with our victory,” he said. “So that Russia will never bring back genocide to Ukraine and will never, ever try to do so. Moscow must lose, once and for all.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': \"Ukraine claims responsibility for attack leading to a huge fire and leaving at least one Russian serviceman missing. Ukraine struck the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in a missile attack that left the main building in flames and a serviceman missing, according to military officials. The Russian Ministry of Defence initially said one service member was killed on Friday but then issued a statement saying he was missing following the attack in the port city of Sevastopol. The Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in a move largely considered illegal, has been a frequent target since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost 19 months ago. The Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said no one was injured outside of the burning headquarters building. The Ukrainian military claimed responsibility for the attack. “We promised that ‘there will be more,'” Lieutenant General Mykola Oleschuk, the air force commander, said in a social media post that thanked pilots and showed video of air sirens blazing and smoke rising from the building. Razvozhayev said on social media earlier Friday that missile fragments had fallen near a theatre and urged residents to stay clear of the site. “The headquarters of the fleet have been hit in an enemy missile attack,” Razvozhayev said. In a second post, he warned that another aerial attack could be imminent, urging residents of the city, which is home to more than 500,000 people, to remain indoors. “Attention everyone! Another attack is possible. Please do not go to the city centre. Do not leave buildings,” he said. “Everyone who is near the headquarters of the fleet – at the sound of the siren proceed to shelters,” Razvozhayev added. He said rescue workers were at the scene, adding, “Firefighters are taking all measures to eliminate the fire as soon as possible.” Later on Friday, the Moscow-appointed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said on Telegram that several cruise missiles had been intercepted over Crimea. “Over the territory of the Republic of Crimea, air defence has shot down cruise missiles,” he said, without specifying how many missiles were shot down.      Ukrainian and Russian attacks in and around the Black Sea have increased since Moscow withdrew from an accord that allowed safe passage to civilian cargo ships from three Ukrainian ports. Ukraine has urged its allies to provide its armed forces with long-range missiles so it can target positions deeper inside Russia-controlled territory. Western leaders have hesitated over concerns Ukraine could target Russian territory and thereby escalate the conflict. Both France and the United Kingdom, however, have supplied Kyiv’s forces with the weapons. As part of the increasingly frequent barrages on Crimea, Ukraine said earlier this week it had attacked a military airfield near the town of Saky. A source in Ukraine’s SBU security service said there were at least a dozen warplanes and Pantsir missile defence systems at the airfield when the attack took place. The airfield also housed a training centre for operators of drones that Russia has used to target Ukraine. The SBU source said that Ukraine had deployed a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles that “overwhelmed Russian air defences” and then launched Neptune cruise missiles. Kyiv has also repeatedly targeted and hit – the only bridge that connects the peninsula to the Russian mainland, on several occasions leaving damage that took weeks to repair. The last significant attack in July affected the road section of the bridge, which can also accommodate rail traffic and has also been used to transport military equipment. Russian officials said on Friday that traffic across the bridge had been temporarily paused. Civilian maritime traffic was stopped earlier on Friday in Sevastopol, Russian-installed authorities said, without providing details. The Russian Defence Ministry said its forces had shot down one guided missile and two drones that had targeted the peninsula.               Follow Al Jazeera English:\"},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Vice President Han Zheng, a second-tier official, repeats familiar talking points in speech to 78th UNGA. China has reiterated its position that a ceasefire and peace talks are the “only way” to end the war in Ukraine, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. “Cessation of hostilities and the resumption of peace talks is the only way to settle the Ukraine crisis,” Vice President Han Zheng told the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) at its annual meeting. China has tried to position itself as a peacemaker and neutral arbiter in the conflict, although it has refused to condemn Moscow over the invasion. In February, on the first anniversary of the war, it released a position paper on how to bring about an end to the fighting, but the proposals received a lukewarm response in Moscow and Kyiv. China, one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council, wants to “continue playing a constructive role”, Han added. He did not elaborate. Visiting Moscow this week,\\xa0China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov that China would uphold an independent and impartial position on Ukraine as it tried to find a political settlement to the issue. Beijing’s efforts at mediating a resolution to the conflict have made little progress amid scepticism about its professed neutrality given its deepening ties with Russia. Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Moscow in March, where he met Vladimir Putin and toasted a “new era” of cooperation, while Putin has accepted an invitation to visit China next month. Han, a second-tier official, also used his UNGA speech to reiterate China’s vision for an alternative world order free from what it has long called “Western hegemony”.      Appealing to the world’s developing nations, he said China, the world’s second-biggest economy, considered itself part of the Global South. “As the largest developing country, China is a natural member of the Global South. It breathes the same breath with other developing countries and shares the same future with them,” Han said. He also said China supports those nations’ development path “in keeping with their national conditions”. The loosely defined term “Global South” has come up frequently at the UN this year and is usually used to refer to countries from Africa, Asia and Latin America. China has cast itself as a leader for the developing world, stepping up its claim with the launch more than a decade ago of Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative to drive Chinese development, infrastructure and influence mainly in developing economies. China is the world’s second-largest economy after the United States with a GDP of $18 trillion. Xi was one of four leaders from the permanent members of the Security Council who did not attend this year’s meeting. French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Russia’s Putin also skipped the event, leaving US President Joe Biden the only leader of a permanent Security Council member to address the assembly.

In brief public remarks before the White House Cabinet on Thursday, Zelenksyy struck a note of gratitude, calling his negotiations in Washington “productive” and “strong”. “Thank you for all these 575 days,” he said, referencing the length of time since Russia invaded in February 2022. “Thanks to the American people, all these days they are together with us, with Ukrainians, with ordinary people, all of us.” He also highlighted new military assistance, worth $128m, announced by US President Joe Biden on Thursday. “It has exactly what our soldiers need now,” he said, calling it a “very powerful package”. Biden, a Democrat, used his presidential “drawdown authority” to authorise the aid, as further funds for Ukraine prove to be a sticking point in the US Congress. “Today, I approved the next tranche of US security assistance to Ukraine, including more artillery, more ammunition, more anti-tank weapons,” he said. “And next week, the first US Abrams tanks will be delivered to Ukraine.” The Cabinet meeting culminates a whirlwind charm offensive from the Ukrainian president, who travelled to New York earlier this week to rally support among world leaders at the United Nations. But as Zelenskyy faced US lawmakers on Thursday, the stakes were particularly high. Since the full-scale Russian invasion began in 2022, the US has committed more money than any single country to aid Ukraine, with much of that support taking the form of military assistance. The US Congress itself has approved aid amounting to over $113bn. But the last time Congress voted on an aid package was in December — and control of the House of Representatives has since switched hands, from Democrats to Republicans. Nevertheless, Biden has called on Congress to approve an additional $24bn for Ukraine aid, a request that Republicans, particularly on the far right, have baulked at. Some have called instead to slash funding for Ukraine, in favour of domestic priorities and limited government spending. That perspective was on full display on Thursday, as Zelenskyy toured Capitol Hill. US media reported that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy refused Zelenskyy’s request to address a joint session of Congress during his visit, as he had last December. And while the Ukrainian leader was meeting with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, 28 Republican Congress members signed and published a letter on Thursday opposing additional expenditures for Ukraine. The US Congress is facing a September 30 deadline to pass budget legislation or face a government shutdown. “The American people deserve to know what their money has gone to,” the 28 Republicans wrote. “How is the counteroffensive going? Are the Ukrainians any closer to victory than they were 6 months ago? What is our strategy, and what is the president’s exit plan?” They added it would be “an absurd abdication of congressional responsibility” to grant President Biden’s request for more aid without answers first. Al Jazeera correspondent Kimberly Halkett said the contrast in reception to Zelenskyy’s first wartime appearance in Washington, DC, last December was stark. “There is a lot more pushback on Capitol Hill than Volodymyr Zelenskyy is used to,” she said from outside the White House. “Initially, he had received a warm welcome, bipartisan support in terms of approvals for funding for Ukraine’s defence and standing ovations all around. But this time there have been questions about how that money will be spent, where the past money has gone, and even whether the US can afford it.” She warned that “war fatigue” among the US public would be an ongoing hurdle to Zelenskyy’s cause.      Still, Congressional Democrats rallied in support of Ukraine spending, echoing the party’s commitment to “stand behind” the war-torn country. “This is a struggle between Ukraine and Russia,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in his weekly press briefing on Thursday. “But it is also a struggle on the global stage between democracy and autocracy, between freedom and tyranny, between truth and propaganda, between good and evil. And it’s important for us to stand behind Ukraine until victory is won.” Biden echoed those sentiments later at the White House Cabinet meeting. “The entire world has a stake in making sure that no nation, no aggressor, is allowed to take a neighbour’s territory by force. The American people will never waver in their commitment to those values,” he said. As Biden shook hands with Zelenskyy and prepared to leave the Cabinet meeting, a reporter shouted from the sidelines to ask whether the US Congress would ultimately pass the requested aid for Ukraine. Biden paused before responding. “I’m counting on the good judgement of the United States Congress,” he said. “There’s no alternative.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '21 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': \"Ukrainian President Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington comes as Republican opposition to more US aid for Ukraine grows. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in the United States capital to meet US President Joe Biden, legislators, and defence officials in an effort to rally continued funding from Washington for the fight against Russia’s invasion. The US has sent about $114bn in security and humanitarian aid to help Zelenskyy’s government since the beginning of the conflict in February 2022. Since then, lawmakers in the US Congress – where Democrats have a majority in the US Senate and Republicans have a hold on the House of Representatives – have maintained bipartisan support for assistance to Kyiv. But Zelenskyy’s visit on Thursday has come amid signs that the sands could be shifting, with some high-profile Republicans expressing growing scepticism over the steep price of continued US support for Ukraine’s defences. Other segments of the GOP have outright rejected the prospect of more aid and threatened to wield their influence to scuttle or slow-roll legislation that would be needed to approve additional funding. The issue has coalesced around a government spending bill that needs to be passed by the end of the month to avoid a federal government shutdown, with some Republicans opposing the White House’s push to attach $24bn more in aid to Ukraine to the legislation.      Here is what US legislators have recently said about more US aid to Ukraine: Reflecting the position of the Democratic Party and the White House, Schumer has decried efforts by some Republicans to pass a spending bill that does not include further aid to Ukraine. On Monday, he called the proposal “an insult to Ukraine and a gift to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin”. He decried the effort on social media as a “far-right screed”. Despite opposition within his party, McConnell has remained forceful in his support for aid to Ukraine. Instead, he has criticised Biden, a Democrat, for being too “timid” in rallying that support. “I sometimes get the sense that I speak more about Ukraine matters than the president does,” he told reporters on Wednesday. I was proud to welcome President\\xa0@ZelenskyyUa\\xa0to the Capitol this morning\\xa0and hear firsthand about the status of Ukraine’s counteroffensive. American support for Ukraine is not charity. It’s in our own direct interests – not least because degrading Russia helps to deter China. pic.twitter.com/u0W32MIRrw — Leader McConnell (@LeaderMcConnell) September 21, 2023  Paul has gone a step further than many of his colleagues, saying he would seek to slow-roll any government funding bill if it contains further funding for Ukraine. “Today I’m putting congressional leadership & [Biden] on notice that I will oppose any effort to hold the federal government hostage for Ukraine funding. I will not consent to expedited passage of any spending measure that provides any more US aid to Ukraine,” the US senator wrote on X, the website formerly known as Twitter. The stance means that the Senate would likely be unable to fast-track approval of a spending bill once it is approved by the US House of Representatives. While a bill with more aid to Ukraine would likely still pass in the Senate, the slowdown would bring legislators to the brink of a government shutdown, and increase leverage for opponents seeking to drop the Ukraine aid from the package. Today I'm putting congressional leadership & @POTUS on notice that\\xa0I will oppose any effort to hold the federal government hostage for Ukraine funding. I will not consent to expedited passage of any spending measure that provides any more US aid to Ukraine.… — Rand Paul (@RandPaul) September 20, 2023  McCarthy, whose party controls the House, has also become increasingly tepid towards the prospect of more aid for Ukraine, a departure from his staunch support earlier in the year. Underscoring that softened position is McCarthy’s decision not to give Zelenskyy the opportunity to address the House during his visit to Capitol Hill, although the Ukrainian president is expected to meet some House legislators elsewhere during his visit. “Look, what Russia has done – invade – is wrong,” McCarthy told reporters on Tuesday. “We want to make sure that ends. I also have always said from the beginning, no matter what the issue is, I want accountability for whatever the hardworking taxpayers spend their money on, and I want a plan for victory.” He added he did not need to commit anything to Zelenskyy, and he had “questions” for the Ukrainian leader. “Where is the accountability on the money we already spent? What is the plan for victory? I think that’s what the American public wants to know.”      In advance of Zelenskyy’s visit, a group of 23 Republican legislators – including Senators JD Vance, Rand Paul, Mike Braun, Tommy Tuberville, Mike Lee, and Roger Marshall – said they would oppose approving further aid to Ukraine until several questions were answered. In a letter to the director of the Office of Management and Budget, they said the public has not been given a clear accounting of how US funding has been used in Ukraine. They also said they wanted more information about Ukraine’s long-term strategy, progress on its continuing counteroffensive against Russian forces, and what the Biden administration defines as “victory in Ukraine”. “It would be an absurd abdication of congressional responsibility to grant this request [for further Ukraine aid] without knowing the answers to these questions,” they wrote.

       "  'Date': '21 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Warsaw, one of Kyiv’s top allies since the Russian invasion began, took the surprise decision amid a row over Ukrainian grain. Kyiv, Ukraine – “I can’t believe the friendship is over.” That is what Maryna Vasilevskaya, a Ukrainian woman of Polish origin, told Al Jazeera with a heavy sigh on Thursday after learning that Warsaw halted arms supply to Kyiv – and may cut aid to a million Ukrainian refugees it hosts. Poland has supplied hundreds of Soviet-era tanks and 14 Mig-29 fighter jets to Ukraine in its time of need amid Russia’s invasion, served as a major transit hub for weapons from other Western nations, and provided its military bases for training Ukrainian servicemen. It has also spent billions of euros on other forms of aid from the construction of temporary houses for refugees to donating medical supplies and power generators. Vasilevskaya and her children were among the most vulnerable and desperate recipients of Poland’s aid – as well as its overwhelming, heart-melting moral support. Her paternal grandparents were ethnic Poles, and she spent four months in the eastern Polish city of Krakow with her daughters aged five and eight last year after fleeing the Russian onslaught. She returned to Kyiv in August because her husband Vladislav had a medical emergency and her eldest daughter Darya missed her schoolmates. But despite the latest tensions, Vasilevskaya says she remains “eternally grateful” to Polish authorities and public. She arrived in Krakow in mid-March 2022 on a slow overnight train jam-packed with crying children and frightened, disoriented grownups, but Poles welcomed them all like “dearest friends”. “They helped us any way they could with everything, absolutely everything, from food and clothes to lodging and healthcare,” the 34-year-old, who works in marketing, recalled with tears in her eyes. “I thought, ‘Oh my God,’ our dislike to each other is finally over.’” Poland once conquered huge swaths of Kyivan Rus, a medieval Eastern European confederation of principalities that spawned what is Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. It also was a conduit of Western influences from philosophy to visual arts, but its efforts to convert its Orthodox Christian subjects in what is now Ukraine to Roman Catholicism met resistance that partly paved the way to Moscow’s takeover. The fertile “black earth” of Ukraine was Poland’s breadbasket – and the continuing diplomatic spat is also grounded in grain. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Wednesday that Warsaw is “no longer transferring weapons to Ukraine because we are now arming Poland with more modern weapons”. His announcement followed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s speech at the United Nations General Assembly in which he accused Poland, Slovakia and Hungary of aiding Russia by banning the import of Ukrainian grain. Presently, the grain cannot be shipped across the Black Sea because Russia pulled out of a UN-brokered “grain deal” allowing safe passage of cargo ships. “It’s alarming to see how some in Europe play solidarity in a political theatre – making a thriller from the grain,” Zelenskyy, a former comedian and film actor, said. “They may seem to play their own role, but in fact, they are helping set the stage to a Moscow actor.” Kyiv complained to the World Trade Organization about Poland, Slovakia and Hungary, and embargoed the imports of Polish apples, cabbages, tomatoes and onions. The embargo became a final straw – it enraged Poland’s governing right-wing Law and Justice, which relies on the support of farmers and rural residents and is readying for the October 15 parliamentary elections. On Monday, Warsaw said it may also not extend support for Ukrainian refugees that includes work permits, free schooling and access to healthcare and other benefits. “These regulations will simply expire next year,” government spokesman Piotr Mullter said. The halt of Poland’s military aid is “sensitive”, said a top Ukrainian military expert. “This is all abnormal, it all waters [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s mill,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, the former deputy chief of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces, told Al Jazeera. “In the nearest future, [Polish and Ukrainian] presidents have to meet and find points of understanding,” he said. Other analysts were less optimistic. “Polish elites are enraged, and this could become a freezing point of relations,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. He believed that ties could only be mended after dismissals in the Ukrainian halls of power. Deputy Economy Minister Taras Kachka who introduced the embargo on Polish foodstuffs and his boss Yulia Sviridenko may be among those who have to be sacked, he said. Some Ukrainians viewed the spat as nothing but a temporary blunder. “Of course, they have to protect their farmers, just like we have to protect ours,” Volodymyr Sinitsa, a retired bus driver who grew up in a village in the central Ukrainian region of Cherkasy, told Al Jazeera. But some responded with indignation. “They’re revengeful; they always accuse us of genocide and other things we never did,” Konstantin Davydenko, a 22-year-old serviceman, told Al Jazeera. He referred to what Warsaw calls the “Volyn massacre” of civilians in Nazi Germany-occupied Poland. Warsaw has claimed the Ukrainian Insurgent Army that sided with Nazi Berlin to expel Russians from Ukraine killed up to 100,000 ethnic Poles and considers their massacre “genocide”. Ukraine, where UPA’s key leaders are lionised as war heroes and freedom fighters, has disagreed with the term and the number of victims. The massacre took place in the regions of Volyn and Galicia, which were annexed by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and are now part of western Ukraine. After World War II, ethnic Poles who remained there faced discrimination. One of them was former refugee Vasilevskaya’s great-grandfather Felix, who lost his job as chief doctor at a children’s hospital in the western city of Lviv. He was sentenced to 10 years in Siberian jails and survived only because he “helped fix career criminals” who provided him with food and support from prison guards, she said. When growing up, she occasionally heard an ethnic slur demeaning her Polish roots, but hoped that the help Poland provided to Ukrainians during the war would put an end to tensions. “I hoped our countries could overcome this darkness between us. I still do,” Vasilevskaya said.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Valery Zaluzhny said that 36 of 43 Russian cruise missiles launched overnight were intercepted and destroyed by Ukraine’s air defences. Seven people were reported injured in the capital, Kyiv, including a nine-year-old girl, the city’s Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said. Some residential and commercial buildings also suffered damaged. Missile debris fell in central Kyiv and non-residential buildings were damaged in the east of the city, causing a fire, he said. Russia launched more than 20 cruise missile against targets in Kyiv, said Sergiy Popko, head of the city’s military administration. “According to initial reports, cruise missiles of the X-101/555/55 type were launched from about 10 Tu-95MS strategic aircraft,” Popko said on the Telegram messaging app. “More than 20 enemy targets were destroyed by air defence forces…. As a result of the downing of the missiles, debris fell in several areas of the capital,” he said. Officials and local media also reported attacks in Ukraine’s Cherkasy, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskiy, Rivne, Vinnytsia, Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk regions. In the southern city of Kherson, two people were killed and five injured by Russian artillery shelling that hit a residential building, the regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. “We know of two dead civilians…they were inside the dormitory,” Prokudin said on Telegram. At least six blasts hit the Slobidskyi district of Kharkiv, damaging civilian infrastructure, regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Two people were sent to hospitals, according to reports. Approximately 10 people were injured and at least one person was rescued from beneath rubble in the Cherkasy region, said Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine’s Minister of Internal Affairs. More than 20 people may still be buried under the rubble, the region’s Governor Ihor Taburets said. Rescue services were working to clear the debris, he said.

       "  'Text': 'Russia’s Ministry of Defence did not release information regarding possible casualties or damage in the latest air raid. Russian aerial defence systems destroyed a wave of 19 Ukrainian drones that were launched overnight in attacks against targets in the Russia-annexed Crimean peninsula, the surrounding Black Sea and other regions of Russia. The Russian defence ministry said early on Thursday that it had “thwarted” the attacks by Ukraine’s aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). “In the night from 20th to 21st September, an attempt by the Kyiv regime to commit a terrorist attack with lethal drones on sites in the Russian Federation was intercepted,” the defence ministry said on the Telegram messaging app. “Air defence systems destroyed 19 Ukrainian UAVs over the Black Sea and the territory of the Republic of Crimea, and one each over the territories of Kursk, Belgorod and Oryol regions,” the ministry said. The Belgorod and Kursk regions of Russia border eastern Ukraine, while Oryol is closer to the capital, Moscow. The defence ministry provided no details on casualties or possible damage.      Kyiv has promised to recapture the Black Sea peninsula and Ukrainian forces have launched aerial attacks with increasing frequency on targets in Crimea, which was seized and annexed by Russia in 2014. Russian naval targets in the Black Sea have also been hit, including attacks by surface seaborne drones launched by Kyiv. On Wednesday, the Ukrainian military said its forces had successfully struck a Russian Black Sea fleet command post near Sevastopol in Crimea. Ukrainian media reported that loud explosions were heard in Crimea, particularly in the area of the Belbek and Kacha military airfields. Both are located north of Sevastopol. Authorities in Crimea have downplayed the incident and said that Ukrainian attacks are being successfully repelled.      Oleg Kryuchkov, an adviser to the Russia-appointed governor of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, said on Telegram: “We are asking all Crimeans to remain calm. “If you hear the sounds of a drone flying by or air defence systems, move away from the windows … If you find the wreckage of a UAV shot down by air defence or landed by electronic warfare, please contact special services or hotlines.” Ukraine’s ability to launch long-range attacks against targets in Crimea, the Black Sea and Russia has been noted by military analysts as displaying Kyiv’s growing offensive sophistication. Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, said a recent attack by Ukraine on the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol demonstrated Kyiv’s ability to launch complex attacks using missiles and drones. “This kind of operation is one of the reasons I remain confident that Ukraine will win the war – they have the ability to execute complex operations at a much higher level than the Russians,” O’Brien said earlier this week.

       "  'Text': 'Ukraine’s forces also capture two towns in the east as they flank Bakhmut city, erode Russian defences in the south. Ukraine destroyed state-of-the-art Russian air defences in Crimea and captured two key towns near the eastern city of Bakhmut in the 82nd week of the war. Ukrainian forces may also have put three modern Russian warships out of action, demonstrating an increasing ability to attack enemy assets at range while maintaining the momentum of their territorial gains. Ukraine appears to have used naval drones to mount two separate attacks on Russian warships on September 14. Ukraine’s Strategic Command claimed it struck two of Russia’s Vasily Bykov Project 22160-class patrol ships causing unspecified damage. The Ukrainian government released video footage of the Vasily Bykov, commissioned in 2018, firing at a surface drone as it apparently closes in for attack. Russia’s defence ministry said only that its Black Sea Fleet had “destroyed two unmanned\\xa0semi-submersible boats… in the southwestern part of the Black Sea”, belonging to Ukraine. Separately, the Ukrainska Pravda news outlet reported that a naval drone had caused damage to the rear starboard hull of a Bora-class guided missile corvette, the Samum, near the entrance to Sevastopol port, forcing it to be towed for repairs “with a roll to starboard”. “For this attack, the SBU [Ukraine’s secret service] used an experimental model of a marine drone, which is capable of operating in a storm, hiding from detection behind high waves,” Ukrainska Pravda reported. “During the special operation, the height of the waves reached 1.5-2 metres,” the news outlet added.      Russia’s defence ministry said the Samum had successfully defended itself and destroyed the “unmanned naval boat”, but photographs circulated online showed the Samum being towed by two tugboats. A day later, Ukraine reportedly attacked another Russian patrol boat, the Askold, with unknown results. Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, called the attack on the Samum “one of the most well executed and planned operations of this war so far”, adding, “Ukraine is not only holding its own in the seapower war – it is actually winning it”. Ukraine has been stepping up attacks on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and its base in Crimea, at Sevastopol. On September 12, Ukraine launched missiles and drones to successfully hit the Russian landing ship, Minsk, and a Kilo-class submarine docked at Sevastopol for repairs. The war at sea has escalated since July 17. Ukraine used unmanned surface drones to damage the Kerch Bridge – the second time it succeeded in doing so – connecting Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, which was annexed by Moscow in 2014, to the Russian mainland. Russia pulled out of a UN-backed agreement in July that had allowed Ukraine to export many thousands of tonnes of grain from its blockaded Black Sea ports. After pulling out of the deal, Russia warned that it would use its naval power to stop Black Sea exports by Ukraine.      Russia has since struck Ukrainian ports and grain silos on the Danube river in a clear effort to prevent exports across the river to Romania and onward through European overland. Ukraine has responded by intensifying long-distance attacks against Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and against Crimea. Ukraine destroyed a Russian state-of-the-art S-400 ‘Triumf’ air defence missile system in Crimea on August 23, and two days later used a drone swarm to attack the Russian 126th Guards Coastal Defence Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet near Perevalne in Crimea. On September 14, Ukraine destroyed another S-400 battery, near Yevpatoria, a western Crimean port. Russia said only that it had shot down 11 drones in Yevpatoria, but geolocated footage showed plumes of smoke in the area of the reported attack. A source with Kyiv’s secret service told Ukrainian Pravda that a combination of unmanned aerial drones and Neptune missiles were used in the attack, with the drones hitting the Russian air defence battery’s antennae and the missiles striking its launchers.      The combination of aerial and surface drones with missiles, as used in Yevpatoria and Sevastopol, is becoming a hallmark of Ukrainian long-distance attacks which military analysts say points to evolving sophistication of strategy. According to reports, the attack on the S-400 missile defence system in Yevpatoria could leave Russia with just three S-400 batteries protecting the occupied Crimean peninsula. “If the Ukrainians can keep it up and continue to sink Russian shipping in Sevastopol, they could force the Black Sea Fleet to rebase to Russia, which would be a key step in their plan to seize back Crimea,” O’Brien said. Ukraine’s pushback against the Russian fleet appeared to be having results. Ukraine’s Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said five merchant vessels had docked in Ukrainian grain ports and departed with cargoes since August 15. Ukrainian officials say the attacks on the Russian navy will continue, and that the Black Sea Fleet is already keeping its ships constantly on the move between Crimea and Russian naval bases due to fear of attack. Ukrainian forces captured the town of Andriivka, five kilometres south of Bakhmut, on September 14, Ukraine’s general staff said. Ukraine’s 3rd Separate Assault Brigade said that it conducted “a lightning operation” which surrounded the Russian garrison at Andriivka, cut it off from the main force, and in two days destroyed “almost all the infantry of the 72nd [Separate Motorised Rifle] Brigade, together with officers and a significant amount of equipment”. Since the Russian capture of Bakhmut in late May, Ukraine has been slowly flanking the city to the north and south. Three days after the recapture of Andriivka, Ukrainian troops hoisted their flag over the neighbouring town of Klishchiivka, also south of Bakhmut.      Ukrainian ground forces commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said the liberation of Andriivka and Klishchiivka has also destroyed the combat capabilities of two elite airborne Russian formations, the 31st Guards VDV Brigade, and the 83rd Guards VDV Brigade. Geolocated footage showed that Ukrainian troops were also advancing near Rozdolivka, northwest of Bakhmut. “The liberation of Klishchiivka, as well as continued Ukrainian tactical gains northwest of Bakhmut, are tactical gains of strategic significance because they are allowing Ukrainian forces to fix a considerable portion of Russian airborne [VDV] elements in the Bakhmut area,” Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said. The ISW believes that the military resources Russia has thrown into holding Bakhmut for reasons of political prestige have enabled Ukraine to poke holes in well-prepared Russian defences on the southern front lines, particularly western Zaporizhia. There, Ukrainian forces were advancing west of Robotyne on September 16, a town they captured in late August, and west of Verbove, a town they are now focused on. In this sector, Ukrainian and Western officials agree that Ukrainian troops have penetrated the first Russian defensive layer and are now attacking the second layer of Russia’s front line. If they manage to break through Russian defences here, Ukrainian troops could in theory pour behind Russian positions.            Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Ukraine’s Zelenskyy tells special Security Council meeting that the only way to lasting peace is the full withdrawal of Russian troops. In Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s first in-person appearance at a UN Security Council meeting on Moscow’s invasion of his country, he told a special meeting that the Russian veto has rendered the world body “ineffective”. Zelenskyy said that the United Nations was at a dead end regarding aggressions and suggested Russia be stripped of its veto right as one of five permanent members of the post-World War II Security Council as punishment for attacking Ukraine. “Everyone in the world can see what exactly makes the UN ineffective. In this seat in the Security Council, which Russia occupies illegally due to behind-the-scenes manipulations after the collapse of the Soviet Union, sit liars whose job it is to justify the aggression and genocide committed by Russia,” he said. “The veto in the hands of the aggressor is what drove the UN into a dead end. No matter who you are, the existing UN system still makes you less than the veto power that only a few have and that is used by one – Russia – to the detriment of all other UN members,” he said. “Many years of talks and projects on reforming the UN should become a process of reforming the UN. The use of the veto is what needs reform, and this could be a key reform,” he noted. He added that the only way to a lasting peace was a full withdrawal of Russian troops and restoration of Kyiv’s control over its territory within the 1991 borders following the fall of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, Russian forces on Wednesday shelled the city of Toretsk in eastern Ukraine, killing four people, the Ukrainian General Prosecutor’s Office has said. Zelenskyy’s visit to the United Nations coincided with a pivotal moment for Ukraine’s military campaign to eject Russian forces from Ukraine.      Public enthusiasm for the war effort is waning in many NATO countries, Ukraine’s summer counteroffensive has hit stubborn Russian defenses and soon colder, wetter weather will make many rural roads impassable for heavy vehicles. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the council on Wednesday that Russia’s war in Ukraine “is aggravating geopolitical tensions and divisions, threatening regional stability, increasing the nuclear threat, and creating deep fissures in our increasingly multipolar world”. Before the meeting started, Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia objected to Zelenskyy addressing the council, which is chaired by Albania for September, before the 15 members. “I want to assure our Russian colleagues and everyone here that this is not a special operation by the Albanian presidency,” Albania’s Prime Minister Edi Rama told Nebenzia. “There is a solution for this. If you agree, you stop the war and President Zelenskyy will not take the floor.” Russia has said it is carrying out a “special military operation” in Ukraine because that country’s ambitions to integrate with the West – including NATO – pose a threat to Russia’s national security. On Thursday, Zelenskyy heads to Washington to meet with US President Joe Biden, members of Congress and military officials to urge continued support for his country’s war effort. While a majority in Congress still support supplying military aid to Ukraine, sceptical voices among Republicans are growing louder as the war’s cost rises. Biden plans to announce a new military aid package during Zelenskyy’s visit. In a speech to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Biden appealed to world leaders to stand with Ukraine against Russia, saying only Moscow has the power to end the war.

Ukraine and Russia launched waves of drone attacks overnight with reports of a fire at an oil refinery in Ukraine’s Poltava region and four Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) being shot down over two regions in Russia’s west, officials say. A Russian drone hit the Kremenchuk oil refinery in the central Poltava region of Ukraine, causing a fire, the regional governor, Dmytro Lunin, said on Wednesday. “Last night, Russians repeatedly attacked Poltava region. Our air defence system did a good job against enemy UAVs,” he said on the Telegram messaging app. The General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said air defence systems shot down 17 of 24 drones that Russia launched against targets in Ukraine. The Kremenchuk refinery has come under repeated Russian air raids since Moscow launched its invasion last year. Meanwhile, Russian authorities reported on Wednesday that their air defences intercepted four Ukrainian drones.      The Ukrainian drones were shot down over Russia’s Belgorod region which borders Ukraine and the Oryol region, which is closer to Moscow, the Russian Ministry of Defence said, with local officials reporting no damage or casualties. The aircraft-type drones were shot down between 9pm (18:00 GMT on Tuesday) and 11:45pm (20:45 GMT), the ministry said on Telegram. A drone attack was also suspected in a fire involving a large fuel storage tank early on Wednesday morning near an airport in the Russian Black Sea beach resort of Sochi. Veniamin Kondratyev, governor of the Krasnodar region, said preliminary information indicated that there were no casualties. “The reasons for the incident are being investigated,” Kondratyev said on Telegram.      A Russian-language online news portal reported that a drone could have been involved in the fire that engulfed the 1,200 tonnes of fuel, noting that a loud explosion was heard before the fuel tank erupted in flames. Kyiv has in recent months ramped up drone and missile attacks deep inside Russia and Russian-controlled territory following a promise by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that his forces would bring the war in Ukraine back to Russia.

       "  'Text': 'Ukraine says more than 19,000 children have been taken illegally by Russia since it began its full-scale invasion. Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska has called on world leaders to help ensure the return of thousands of Ukrainian children forcibly taken by Russia as Belarusian state media published photos of dozens of Ukrainian children arriving in Belarus from Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine. Speaking on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Zelenska said more than 19,000 Ukrainian children had been forcibly transferred or deported to Russia or the territories it has occupied. So far, only 386 have been brought home. In Russia, “they were told that their parents don’t need them, that their country doesn’t need them, that nobody is waiting for them,” Zelenska said. “The abducted children were told that they are no longer Ukrainian children, that they are Russian children.” Her call came as Belta, Belarus’s state-run news agency, reported 48 children from the Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhia regions arrived in the country, a close Russian ally, for a “three week holiday” on Tuesday. The children were shown getting off a train carrying backpacks and suitcases, mostly looking solemn. Belta said the initiative was organised by a Belarusian charity backed by President Alexander Lukashenko, who has previously called the state-funded removals a “recuperation” programme. “The president, despite external pressure, said this important humanitarian project should continue,” Alexei Talai, the charity’s head, was quoted as saying by the news agency. “All the Belarusian people,” he said, want to help “children from dilapidated cities and towns in the new territories of Russia.”      In March, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s children’s rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova. The judges in The Hague said they found “reasonable grounds to believe” the two were responsible for war crimes, including the illegal deportation and transfer of children from occupied parts of Ukraine to Russia. In June, Belarusian opposition figures gave the ICC materials, which they said showed more than 2,100 Ukrainian children from at least 15 Russian-occupied Ukrainian cities had been forcibly transferred to Belarus with Lukashenko’s approval. Ukraine says the children are being indoctrinated and deprived of their national identity, which President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described as a genocide in his speech to the UNGA on Tuesday. “Those children in Russia are taught to hate Ukraine, and all ties with their families are broken,” Zelenskyy told the General Assembly. “This is clearly a genocide.” Russia denies the allegations, saying instead it has saved Ukrainian children from the horrors of the war. More than 500 children have been killed in Ukraine since Russia began its full-scale invasion of its neighbour some 19 months ago, and hundreds of others have been injured. Ukrainian authorities are also investigating more than 230 cases of sexual violence by Russian soldiers against civilians, including 13 children, according to Zelenska. She said the child victims include 12 girls and one boy, with the youngest victim only four years old at the time of the alleged crime. “I am turning to the UN secretary-general and the entire organisation to help us save Ukrainian children,” Zelenska pleaded. “Help us receive information on the children taken to Russia… Help us take children out of occupied territories through special safe corridors. Our children need justice.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'The Ukrainian president used his 15 minute slot to warn UN members of the dangers of not standing up to aggression. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy travelled to New York to address the United Nations General Assembly in person for the first time since Moscow began its full-scale invasion of his country in February 2022. Dressed in his trademark khaki green shirt, he urged member states to come together to oppose Russian aggression and stressed the need for a peace recognising Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Here is the full text of Zelenskyy’s speech from September 19. I welcome all who stand for common efforts! And I promise – being really united we can guarantee fair peace for all nations. What’s more, unity can prevent wars. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Secretary General! Fellow leaders! This hall saw many wars but not as active defender against the aggressions. In many cases, the fear of war, the final war, was the loudest here – the war after which no one would gather in the General Assembly Hall again. The Third World War was seen as a nuclear war. A conflict between states on the highway to nukes. Other wars seemed less scary compared to a threat of the so-called “great powers” firing their nuclear stockpiles. So, the 20th century taught the world to restrain from the use of the weapons of mass destruction – not to deploy, not to proliferate, not to threaten with, and not to test, but to promote a complete nuclear disarmament. Frankly, this is a good strategy. But it should not be the only strategy to protect the world from this final war. Ukraine gave up its third-largest nuclear arsenal. The world then decided Russia should become a keeper of such power. Yet, history shows it was Russia who deserved nuclear disarmament the most, back in 1990s. And Russia deserves it now – terrorists have no right to hold nuclear weapons. But truly not the nukes are the scariest now. While nukes remain in place, the mass destruction is gaining its momentum. The aggressor is weaponising many other things and those things are used not only against our country but against all of yours as well. Fellow leaders! There are many conventions that restrict weapons but there are no real restrictions on weaponisation. First, let me give you an example – the food. Since the start of the full-scale war, the Ukrainian ports in the Black and Azov Seas have been blocked by Russia. Until now, our ports on the Danube River remain the target for missiles and drones. And it is a clear Russia’s attempt to weaponise the food shortage on the global market in exchange for recognition for some, if not all, of the captured territories. Russia is launching the food prices as weapons. The impact spans from the Atlantic coast of Africa to the Southeast Asia. This is the threat scale. I would like to thank those leaders who supported our Black Sea Grain Initiative, and program “Grain from Ukraine”. United, we made weapons turn back into food again. More than 45 nations saw how important it is to make Ukrainian food products available on the market… from Algeria and Spain to Indonesia and China. Even now when Russia has undermined the Black Sea Grain Initiative, we are working to ensure food stability. And I hope that many of you will join us in these efforts. We launched a temporary sea export corridor from our ports. And we are working hard to preserve the land routes for grain exports. And it is alarming to see how some in Europe play out solidarity in a political theatre – making thriller from the grain. They may seem to play their own role but in fact, they are helping set the stage to a Moscow actor.      Second, weaponisation of energy. Many times, the world has witnessed Russia using energy as a weapon. Kremlin weaponised oil and gas to weaken the leaders of other countries. Now the threat is even greater. Russia is weaponising nuclear energy. Not only it is spreading its unreliable nuclear-power-plant-construction-technologies, but it is also turning other countries’ power plants into real dirty bombs. Look what Russia did to our Zaporizhzhia power plant – shelled it, occupied it and now blackmails others with radiation leaks. Is there any sense to reduce nuclear weapons when Russia is weaponising nuclear power plants? Scary question. The global security architecture offers no response or protection against such a treacherous radiation threat… And there is no accountability for radiation blackmailers so far. The third example is children. Unfortunately, various terrorist groups abduct children to put pressure on their families and societies. But never before the mass kidnapping and deportation would become a part of the government policy. Not until now. We know the names of tens of thousands of children and have evidence on hundreds of thousands of others kidnapped by Russia in the occupied territories of Ukraine and later deported. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrant for Putin for this crime. We are trying to get children back home but time goes by. What will happen to them? Those children in Russia are taught to hate Ukraine, and all ties with their families are broken… This is clearly a genocide. When hatred is weaponised against one nation, it never stops there. Each decade Russia starts a new war. Parts of Moldova and Georgia remain occupied. Russia turned Syria into ruins. And if not Russia, the chemical weapons would have never been used there in Syria. Russia has almost swallowed Belarus. It is obviously threatening Kazakhstan and the Baltic states… And the goal of the present war against Ukraine is to turn our land, our people, our resources into a weapon against you – against the international rules-based order. Many seats in the General Assembly Hall may become empty if Russia succeeds with its treachery and aggression.      Ladies and gentlemen! The aggressor scatters death and brings ruins even without nukes but the outcomes are alike. We see towns and villages in Ukraine wiped out by Russian artillery. Levelled to the ground completely! We see the war of drones. We know the possible effects of spreading the war into the cyberspace. The artificial intelligence could be trained to combat well – before it would learn to help the humanity. Thank God, people have not yet learned to use climate as a weapon. Even though humanity is failing on its climate policy objectives – this means that extreme weather will still impact the normal global life and some evil state will also weaponise its outcomes. And when people in the streets of New York and other cities of the world went out on climate protest – we all have seen them… And when people in Morocco and Libya and other countries die as a result of natural disasters… And when islands and countries disappear under water… And when tornados and deserts are spreading into new territories… And when all of this is happening, one unnatural disaster in Moscow decided to launch a big war and kill tens of thousands of people. We must act united – to defeat the aggressor and focus all our capabilities and energy on addressing these challenges. As nukes are restrained, likewise the aggressor must be restrained and all its tools and methods of war. Each war now can become final, but it takes our unity to make sure that aggression will NOT break in again. And it is not a dialogue between the so-called “great powers” somewhere behind the closed doors that can guarantee us all the new no-wars-era, but open work of all nations for peace. Last year, I presented the outlines of the Ukrainian peace formula at the UN General Assembly. Later in Indonesia, I presented the full Formula. And over the past year, the Peace Formula became the basis to update the existing security architecture – now we can bring back to life the UN Charter and guarantee the full power of the rules-based world order. Tomorrow, I will present the details at a special meeting of the UN Security Council. The main thing is that it is not only about Ukraine. More than 140 states and international organisations have supported the Ukrainian Peace Formula fully or in part. The Ukrainian Peace Formula is becoming global. Its points offer solutions and steps that will stop all forms of weaponisation that Russia used against Ukraine and other countries and may be used by other aggressors.      Look – for the first time in modern history, we have the chance to end the aggression on the terms of the nation which was attacked. This is a real chance for every nation – to ensure that aggression against your state, if it happens, God forbid, will end not because your land will be divided and you will be forced to submit to military or political pressure, but because your territory and sovereignty will be fully restored. We launched the format of meetings between national security advisers and diplomatic representatives. Important talks and consultations were held in Hiroshima, in Copenhagen, and in Jeddah on the implementation of the Peace Formula. And we are preparing a Global Peace Summit. I invite all of you – all of you who do not tolerate any aggression – to jointly prepare the Summit. I am aware of the attempts to make some shady dealings behind the scenes. Evil cannot be trusted – ask Prigozhin [the former head of the mercenary Wagner group] if one bets on Putin’s promises. Please, hear me. Let unity decide everything openly. While Russia is pushing the world to the final war, Ukraine is doing everything to ensure that after Russian aggression, no one in the world will dare to attack any nation. Weaponisation must be restrained. War crimes must be punished. Deported people must come back home. And the occupier must return to their own land. We must be united to make it. Слава Україні!

       "  'Text': 'Ukraine’s president tells world leaders at UN event in New York that they must ‘act united to defeat the aggressor’. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on world leaders to show unity in the face of Russia’s continued “aggression” in Ukraine, telling the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) that Moscow is “weaponising” food and energy. Speaking from the UN headquarters in New York for the first time since the conflict broke out last year, Zelenskyy on Tuesday portrayed the Russian invasion of Ukraine as an existential threat to the global order akin to nuclear weapons. “We must act united to defeat the aggressor and focus all our capabilities and energy on addressing these challenges,” he said in English.\\xa0“It takes our unity to make sure that [such] aggression will not [happen] again.” Zelenskyy criticised Moscow for what he said was an “attempt to weaponise [a] food shortage on [the] global market in exchange for recognition of some, if not all, of captured territories”. He also accused Russia of committing genocide by kidnapping Ukrainian children and said Kyiv was working on preparing a global peace summit. The war in Ukraine has figured prominently on the first day of the high-level UN General Debate, with several world leaders pledging continued support for Kyiv during the most widely watched event of the UN’s annual calendar.      The United States and its allies have provided billions of dollars worth of humanitarian and security aid for Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022. At the UNGA on Tuesday morning, US President Joe Biden – who will meet Zelenskyy later this week at the White House – told other leaders that “Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalise Ukraine without consequence.” “If we allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure?” Biden asked during his UNGA speech, drawing applause when he said the US and its allies would stand with Ukraine in its fight. “Russia alone bears responsibility for this war,” he said. “Russia alone has the power to end this war immediately.” Biden’s address at the annual gathering was the centrepiece event of his three-day visit to New York, which will include meetings with the heads of five Central Asian nations, and the leaders of Israel and Brazil. The Democratic president has made rallying US allies to support Ukraine a leading component of his administration’s foreign policy amid criticism from some Republican legislators over the breadth and cost of that assistance to Kyiv.      More than 140 heads of state and government ministers are taking part in this week’s 78th session of the UNGA, which offers a chance for countries to present issues of particular concern in a series of live public speeches. In-person attendance has steadily recovered since the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced leaders three years ago to send in prerecorded video messages due to safety precautions. The UN is composed of 193 member states. Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna, reporting from the UN on Tuesday afternoon, said Zelenskyy used his UNGA speech to make it “very clear” that Ukraine needs support. However, Hanna said the address was unlikely to change the views of nations that have remained neutral. “Among some members of the Global South, as well, there’s been public discontent about the amount of time the UN spends on the Ukraine issue at the expense, they believe, of the problems facing the Global South in particular,” he added. Zelenskyy is also expected to speak at a UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine on Wednesday, which could place him at the same table as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The Ukrainian leader will then travel to Washington, DC, on Thursday to meet with Biden. He will also visit the US Capitol, where lawmakers face a September 30 deadline to pass a federal spending bill that will include further aid to his war-torn country.      US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters last week that he believed Zelenskyy was “looking forward” to visiting congressional leaders “to make the case” for continued US support for Ukraine. Meanwhile, in an interview with the Reuters news agency on the sidelines of the UNGA, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday that Ukraine urgently needs air defences, including ammunition and spare parts. Stoltenberg said the conflict was a “war of attrition” but not a stalemate, given the gains Ukraine has made with a counteroffensive it began in June to try to reclaim territory occupied by Russian forces. “If we want an end to the war, if we want a just and lasting peace, then military support to Ukraine is the right way,” the NATO chief said. “Ukraine needs many different types of support.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

The western Ukrainian city of Lviv was rocked by early morning explosions as air defences engaged in stopping waves of Russian air attacks, local officials said. The city’s mayor, Andriy Sadoviy, wrote on the Telegram messaging app early on Tuesday that “air defences are operating in our region”, and warned residents to seek shelter. Ukraine’s Air Force wrote on Telegram that “the threat of Shahed [Iranian-made drones] remains in the Lviv region. Air defences are operating”. Western Ukraine came under an air raid alert starting at about 00:00 GMT. According to reports, several waves of drones attempted to hit targets in Lviv city starting at about 01:30 GMT with numerous explosions heard as air defences intercepted the incoming unmanned aerial vehicles. Sadoviy later reported that a fire at an industrial warehouse had broken out and emergency services were tackling the blaze. Initial reports were of one person injured, he said. “So far, only one person has been injured in the attack,” the mayor said on Telegram, adding that a man in his mid-20s was found under the rubble of a warehouse and transported to hospital. The scale of the attack and full extent of the damage were not immediately known. There was no immediate comment from Russia. The head of the Lviv region’s military administration, Maksym Kozytskyi, said that two people, a man and a woman, were rescued from beneath rubble in the city. “The woman is initially believed to have no injuries. The man is in a serious condition,” he said, adding that the city received the all-clear from air raids at 03:00 GMT. Though far from the front lines of fighting in the east and south of Ukraine, Lviv has come under deadly Russian missile and drone attacks that have targeted civilian infrastructure and residential buildings leading to considerable damage and loss of life among city residents.      \\xa0          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'Ukraine’s ground forces commander General Oleksandr Syrskyi claims three Russian brigades left with no combat capabilities after fighting in east around Bakhmut. The general in command of Ukrainian ground forces said his troops have routed three of the best Russian brigades fighting on the front lines in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine. General Oleksandr Syrskyi also said on Monday that the recapture of two eastern Ukrainian villages in recent days – Klishchiivka and Andriivka, both of which are located on higher ground near the destroyed town of Bakhmut – was an important breakthrough. “In the fighting in the Bakhmut section, some of the enemy’s best units have been crushed and have completely lost their combat power,” Syrskyi said in a statement. The Russian units in question were the 72nd Motor Rifle Brigade as well as the 31st and 83rd Air Assault Brigades. Hailing the recapture of Klishchiivka and Andriivka, Syrskyi said Ukrainian forces were continuing their advance and had some success piercing Russian defence lines, though Moscow’s forces were counterattacking from multiple directions in a bid to regain their lost positions. “These settlements, at first glance small, were important elements in the enemy’s defensive line which stretched from Bakhmut to Horlivka,” Syrskyi said on the Telegram messaging app, referring to a town about 40km (25 miles) from Bakhmut. “As a result of our troops’ successful actions, the enemy’s defensive line – which it tried to close by throwing all available reserves into battle – was breached,” he said. ⚡️Commander: Ukrainian forces breach Russian defensive line near Bakhmut.

Russian forces captured the town of Bakhmut in May but Ukrainian forces continued to fight in fierce urban warfare that became one of the bloodiest and longest battles since Russia invaded last year. Russia denied on Saturday that it had lost control of Andriivka and the latest Ukrainian claims of battlefield gains against Russian forces could not be independently verified.      Washington, DC-based think tank The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on Monday that Ukraine’s advances south of Bakhmut and claims of destroying the combat capabilities of the three Russian brigades could indicate significant losses for Moscow. “These VDV [Russian airborne] elements were involved in counterattacking and attempting to roll back Ukrainian advances around Bakhmut… and likely suffered heavy losses,” the ISW said. The ISW also said that Russian forces south of Bakhmut were “likely battle-weary from recent efforts to hold” Klishchiivka and Andriivka. 3/ Russian forces south of #Bakhmut are also likely battle-weary from recent efforts to hold #Klishchiivka and #Andriivka… — ISW (@TheStudyofWar) September 19, 2023  Ukraine has now regained approximately 50sq kms (more than 19sq miles) of land around Bakhmut since the start of its long-anticipated counteroffensive in June, the slow progress of which has been criticised by some of Kyiv’s Western backers.

       "  'Text': 'Wang Yi and Sergey Lavrov say they share a commitment to a ‘multipolar world’ in their discussion in Moscow. China’s foreign minister has held talks with his Russian counterpart in Moscow as the two countries inch closer amid fraying ties with the West over the Ukraine war and the militarisation of the Pacific. Wang Yi opened his talks with Sergey Lavrov by hailing “strategic cooperation” between the two countries and their shared commitment to a “multipolar world” and a “more just world order”. “China and Russia, as leading global powers and permanent members of the UN Security Council, bear special responsibility for maintaining global strategic stability and global development,” Wang said. The Moscow trip comes days after Wang held talks with United States President Joe Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan in Malta. Sino-US ties have deteriorated in recent years over issues ranging from trade to the Chinese military threat to Taiwan. China’s top diplomat, who will be in Russia until Thursday, plans to hold strategic security consultations with officials there, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, emphasised “the importance of Russian-Chinese cooperation for ensuring justice in world affairs, for ensuring a balance of interests in the processes that are developing in a variety of directions”. He noted that Russia and China will coordinate their efforts during this week’s United Nations General Assembly and other international forums. Meanwhile, Wang stressed that Russia-China cooperation “isn’t directed against anyone and isn’t influenced by any other countries”. Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have promised to strengthen bilateral ties as Beijing has faced criticism from the West for not condemning Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. China has refrained from taking sides in the conflict, saying that while a country’s territory must be respected, the West needs to consider Russia’s security concerns about NATO expansion. It has accused the US of prolonging the fighting by providing arms to Ukraine, weaponry the US says Kyiv needs to fight back against Russia. China and the US have been making efforts to reduce tension, and Beijing and Washington described the talks between Wang and Sullivan, which went on for 12 hours, as “candid, substantive and constructive”. The relationship between the two countries, global and regional security issues, the Ukraine war and the Taiwan Strait were among the topics of discussion, the White House said in a statement, adding that it was eager to maintain open lines of communication with China to better manage the relationship. Similar issues were discussed on Monday between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and China’s Vice President Han Zheng. “The world expects us to responsibly manage our relationship,” Blinken said in brief remarks at the beginning of his meeting with Han. “The United States is committed to doing just that. “From the perspective of the United States, face-to-face diplomacy is the best way to deal with areas where we disagree, and also the best way to explore areas of cooperation between us.” The talks between Wang and Sullivan were also aimed at laying the groundwork for a meeting between Biden and Xi later this year. Ryan Hass, a China expert at the Brookings Institution, said the pace of high-level exchanges between Washington and Beijing suggested that efforts were “purposeful” and not just part of relationship management. “I expect both sides are working to set the stage for a productive meeting between both leaders in November,” Hass said. Wang’s trip to Moscow also comes a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un left Russia following a six-day visit that included talks with President Vladimir Putin at a far eastern spaceport, visits to aircraft plants and inspections of nuclear-capable strategic bombers as well as an advanced warship. Kim’s trip fuelled Western concerns about an arms alliance that could boost Russia’s arsenal for fighting in Ukraine.               Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

Russia says it has no information on the health of Ramzan Kadyrov after reports suggested the Chechen leader was sick. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday: “We have no information on this.” “In any case, the presidential administration can hardly give out health certificates, so we have nothing to tell you here.” Peskov made the remarks after unconfirmed reports on social media said Kadyrov was in a coma. After the rumours began to spread, two videos were released on Sunday of Kadyrov at an unidentified location. In the first, he is seen smiling while on a stroll. In the second, he recommends people play sports. He is heard speaking Chechen and Russian. “I strongly recommend that everyone who cannot distinguish the truth from lies on the internet go for a walk, get some fresh air and put their thoughts in order,” the video’s captions said. “The rain can be wonderfully invigorating”.

Speculation grew about Kadyrov’s health after a report from the Ukrainian news outlet Obozrevatel on Friday cited a spokesperson from the security service saying Kadyrov was in “serious condition. His existing diseases have worsened.” Earlier on Monday, Obozrevatel reported that Kadyrov had allegedly undergone an unsuccessful kidney transplant. Despite a lack of evidence supporting the spokesperson’s claims, they were made after months of rumours that Kadyrov was suffering from kidney issues. Kadyrov has been an ardent backer of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, and his soldiers have fought alongside regular Russian forces there. The former rebel warlord turned Kremlin ally has long called himself President Vladimir Putin’s “foot soldier”. Kadyrov was elected president of Chechnya in 2007. He has ruled majority-Muslim Chechnya while being accused of ordering extrajudicial killings and torture of his opponents.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",
       " {'Title': 'Ukraine to sue Poland, Slovakia and Hungary over grain ban: Politico',\n",
       "  'Date': '18 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Poland, Slovakia and Hungary imposed bans after an influx of Ukrainian grain led to local  farmers’ protests. Kyiv is considering suing Poland, Hungary and Slovakia over their bans on Ukrainian agricultural products, the Politico news outlet reported. The magazine on Monday quoted Ukrainian Trade Representative Taras Kachka as saying that Kyiv could also impose reciprocal measures on Poland if Warsaw did not drop its additional steps. “We would be forced to retaliate on the additional products and would prohibit the import of fruit and vegetables from Poland,” he said. In May, the European Union restricted Ukrainian grain to allow Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia to ban the domestic sales of Ukrainian wheat, maize, rapeseed and sunflower seeds while permitting transit of such cargoes for export elsewhere. While the restriction expired last week, Warsaw, Bratislava and Budapest announced their bans on Ukrainian grain and said they were acting in the interests of their economies and that the move was intended to protect their farmers. The three countries have complained that a glut of Ukrainian grain threatens their domestic markets. Kachka said the bans are “ridiculous”. “I think that Hungary here is making a political statement that it wants to block trade with Ukraine and as well disregard Brussels completely. And that’s why I think that this is a very bold movement against both of us from Budapest,” he said. The EU allowed its ban to expire on Friday after Ukraine said it would take measures to tighten control of exports to neighbouring countries. Kachka said Kyiv was ready to “take on the responsibility to ensure that export from Ukraine is not creating any tsunami in neighbouring countries” and would impose a system of “real-time” export licences for grains. But the Ukrainian official also pointed out that the decision to enforce their bans outside of backing from the EU has raised “the biggest systemic concern” if partners cannot trust that Brussels speaks for the bloc. According to Politico, Kyiv also plans to sue the countries at the World Trade Organization, not through its trade accord with the EU. “I think that all the world should see how member states in the EU behave towards trade partners and their own union, because it can influence other states as well”, he added.

       "  'Text': 'World leaders head to New York to take part in high-level United Nations talks. Here’s all you need to know. The climate crisis and the war in Ukraine are expected to figure prominently at the United Nations this week, as more than 140 leaders and state representatives from around the world descend on New York to address the 78th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA). The high-level General Debate, which begins on Tuesday following two weeks of meetings, is the most widely watched event in the UN’s annual calendar. It provides world leaders and heads of state the opportunity to lay out their priorities for the coming year, urge cooperation on pressing issues, and often, call out their adversaries. “It is a one-of-a-kind moment each year for leaders from every corner of the globe to not only assess the state of the world but to act for the common good,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters last week. “And action is what the world needs now.” This year’s General Debate is being held under the theme, “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”. A series of bilateral discussions will also be held on the sidelines of the event. Here’s all you need to know: New page dedicated to the United Nations General Assembly High-level Week has just been launched! One-stop-shop with lots of useful information on key events during the high-level week of #UNGA78: https://t.co/oZ6fCJVHZl — United Nations Geneva (@UNGeneva) August 28, 2023  The 193-member UN General Assembly debates matters of human rights, international law and cooperation in “economic, social, cultural, educational, and health fields”. It has the ability to pass resolutions and declarations meant to set out the guiding principles of the organisation. According to the UN Charter, the body is also charged with addressing matters of international peace and security not currently being addressed by the UN Security Council (UNSC). The UNGA approves the UN’s sprawling annual budget and one of its six main committees directly oversees the funding of peacekeeping missions around the world. The UNGA president typically delivers the first speech of the General Debate.\\xa0This session’s leader, Dennis Francis from Trinidad and Tobago, has said (PDF) that he wants to prioritise greater multilateralism and equal opportunity during his tenure. Brazil then traditionally delivers the first country speech, with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva expected to make climate change a centrepiece of his address. Lula, who took office in January, has vowed to re-establish Brazil as a global leader in the environment and bolster the protection of the critical Amazon rainforest after years of destruction. The United States, as the host country, will then follow Brazil, with US President Joe Biden set to deliver an address to the General Assembly on Tuesday seeking to assert Washington’s role as a global leader. From there, “the order of speakers then follows a complex algorithm reflecting level of representation, geographical balance, the order in which the request to speak was recorded, and other considerations”, the UN says on its website. About 150 leaders are expected to attend the high-level talks, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said late last week. Among others, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be there, as will Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Both are expected to address the General Assembly and hold talks with Biden on the sidelines of the event. The Reuters news agency also reported last week that Zelenskyy will speak on Wednesday at a UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine, which “could place him at the same table as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov” amid Russia’s ongoing military offensive. Biden will be the only top leader of the UN Security Council’s five permanent, veto-wielding countries – the US, China, Russia, France and the United Kingdom – to attend the high-level week, media outlets have reported. Rishi Sunak will be the first British prime minister in more than a decade to skip the event, saying his busy schedule prevents him from going to New York. French President Emmanuel Macron will also miss the event, citing scheduling conflicts. It remains unclear which Chinese official will attend the summit after the Wall Street Journal reported in early September that Beijing planned to dispatch Vice President Han Zheng instead of sending Foreign Minister Wang Yi on a broader US trip as previously signalled.      Given the diversity of speakers, the General Debate usually covers a range of issues of regional and global interest. Last year’s predominant themes included\\xa0efforts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and climate change – all of which are expected to again figure prominently during this year’s event. Speaking to reporters in late August, the US envoy, Thomas-Greenfield, said she expects most Western countries to exert “intense pressure” on Russia to withdraw troops from neighbouring Ukraine. The invasion has renewed calls to expand decision-making power on the 15-member UN Security Council, where Russia is among the five permanent members – alongside China, France, the United Kingdom and the US – who wield veto power. Concerns over China, maritime security in the Pacific, supply-chain disruptions and human rights are also likely to emerge, particularly as some observers have questioned Beijing’s growing influence at the UN.      Recent coups in Africa, notably in Niger, may also receive heightened attention, as will ongoing conflicts in Sudan and Ethiopia. Meanwhile, ongoing humanitarian crises in places such as Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa and Latin America – and their role in a global migration crisis – may also feature prominently. Meanwhile, the General Debate comes two months before the United Nations’ climate summit, COP28, will be held in Dubai and Guterres, the UN secretary-general, will host a Climate Ambition Summit on the sidelines of this week’s event in New York. “My appeal to world leaders will be clear: This is not the time for posturing or positioning. This is not the time for indifference or indecision. This is a time to come together for real, practical solutions,” Guterres said during a news conference on September 13. Themes set out by UNGA presidents are traditionally broad – and this year’s is no exception. Francis said in a June letter to his predecessor that the 2023 theme “encompasses the recognition that we are at a crossroads in history and that the path ahead will be decisive in determining not only our future, but that of generations to come”. He called for a renewed commitment to multilateralism and urged UN member states to see how they can “undertake coordinated purposive action” to promote peace and security, fight climate change, and promote human rights. The theme also stresses the need to accelerate efforts to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.      The UN has described the Sustainable Development Goals as “an urgent call for action” between nations to address poverty, hunger and other global issues. They were laid out in the so-called “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, which was adopted in 2015 and provides a blueprint for achieving several benchmarks by 2030. The list includes 17 goals, including ensuring quality education, providing clean water and sanitation, and taking urgent action to tackle the climate crisis. The General Debate will be streamed live on UN Web TV, here.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",
       " {'Title': 'Ukraine recaptures Klishchiivka, second eastern village in three days',\n",
       "  'Date': '18 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Zelenskyy welcomes breakthrough that analysts say is of ‘strategic  significance’ to the war in the east. Ukraine said it has taken back the eastern village of Klishchiivka, in what would be Ukraine’s second significant gain in three days in its months-long counteroffensive against the Russian army. The village lies on higher ground about 9km (6 miles) south of Bakhmut and has been the scene of intense fighting for weeks. “Today, I would like to particularly commend the soldiers who, step by step, are returning to Ukraine what belongs to it, namely in the area of Bakhmut,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation on Sunday. The breakthrough in Klishchiivka comes days after Kyiv said it had gained control of the tiny nearby village of Andriivka and as Zelenskyy prepares for his second wartime visit to the United States, a key ally. Zelenskyy said that Kyiv was “preparing new defence solutions for Ukraine” and that “air defence and artillery are the priority”, without providing details. It began its counteroffensive to clear Russian troops from its territory in June. Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of Ukraine’s ground forces who is also in operational control of the counteroffensive, posted a video of Ukrainian troops displaying the blue and yellow national flag on ruined buildings with the sound of fighting in the background. “Klishchiivka was cleared of the Russians,” Syrsky, who has often visited the Bakhmut front line to devise strategy and boost the troops’ morale, said on social media. Klishchiivka was home to about 400 people before Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, and was captured by Russian troops in January of this year. There was no word from Moscow on its positions in the area. It previously denied reports that its troops had been pushed out of Andriivka. Ilya Yevlash, spokesman for Ukrainian troops in the east, said that control over Klishchiivka could help the Ukrainian army encircle Bakhmut, captured by Russia in May after one of the war’s longest and bloodiest battles.      Yevlash said the battle had inflicted “powerful damage” on Russian airborne units, the Akhmat battalion of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, Storm-Z made up of Russian criminals, the Russian General Staff’s military intelligence and motorised rifle units. “We have now gained a staging ground, which will in the future allow us to continue to develop offensive actions and liberate our land from the occupiers,” he said in a televised statement. Analysts said the capture of the two villages was an important breakthrough. “The liberation of Klishchiivka, as well as continued Ukrainian tactical gains northwest of Bakhmut are gains of strategic significance because they are allowing Ukrainian forces to fix a considerable portion of Russian airborne elements in the Bakhmut area,” the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based think tank, wrote in its daily update on the fighting. The latest news from Kyiv came as the US’s highest-ranking military officer sought to temper hopes for a swift advance in the counteroffensive. General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that while the effort had been “slower than the planners had anticipated”, it had been “steady”. He dismissed suggestions from some that the offensive had failed, arguing that Ukraine had “a lot of combat power remaining. The Ukrainians are not a spent force”. However, he warned: “It’ll take a considerable length of time to militarily eject all 200,000 or plus Russian troops out of Russian-occupied Ukraine. That’s a very high bar. It’s going to take a long time to do it.” NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg also warned there would be no swift end to the conflict, in an interview published on Sunday. “Most wars last longer than expected when they first begin,” Stoltenberg told Germany’s Funke media group. “Therefore we must prepare ourselves for a long war in Ukraine,” even if everyone is wishing for a swift peace.      Kyiv has also begun pushing back against Moscow’s forces in the south after building up Western weapons and recruiting more soldiers for its assault battalions. Intelligence updates from the US and United Kingdom suggested there had been more progress on the southern front with the ISW saying Ukrainian forces had probably “made a significant tactical breach” along a section of the southern front line. The UK’s Ministry of Defence, meanwhile, said that Russian forces were reinforcing their secondary defensive line around the occupied town of Tokmak, about 16km (10 miles) behind the southern front line, amid “Russia’s growing concern about Ukrainian tactical penetrations of the first main defensive line to the north”.

       "  'Date': '17 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Thousands of Hasidic Jews visit Uman to see the grave of Rabbi Nachman for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, ignoring the threat from Russia’s invasion. Uman, Ukraine – David Meinhart is confident he arrived in the safest place on Earth. He is in Uman, a city in central Ukraine that annually hosts tens of thousands of Hasidic Jewish pilgrims for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. This year some 32,000 arrived – even though the Russian-Ukrainian war rages 300km (120 miles) to the south, and cruise missiles have struck Uman several times, killing two dozen people, including five children. The war did not scare them off because they believe in their Rabbi’s help from beyond the grave – and remember their forefathers’ millennia-long survival in communities that barely tolerated Jews and occasionally turned hostile to them. Pilgrims chose to flock to the grave of Rabbi Nachman, the founder of the Breslav branch of Hasidism, who died here in 1810. A blessed new year will come to fruition if they celebrate its eve near Nachman’s grave, they say. “We are a people who have lived and survived persecution, wars and dangers for thousands of years,” Meinhart, 62, told Al Jazeera. His family’s past reflects this survival experience.\\xa0His father moved to the United States from Germany before World War II and fought against the Nazis who killed his relatives during the Holocaust. Meinhart was born in the US but moved to Jerusalem 40 years ago to join a Hasidic community and father nine children. This year, he came to Uman with his sons – leaving his wife and daughters behind was his only concession to the possible dangers of war. “I could have brought my wife and my children, but I opted not to,” he said. Some female pilgrims, however, braved the Russian invasion. “There’s no fear,” said Rachel, a 25-year-old French Jew. She is adamant the pilgrimage does change people’s lives for the better, and they return to their rabbi’s grave again and again. “People wouldn’t come back here if [positive] things didn’t happen to them,” Rachel said, standing on Pushkin Street in central Uman, the epicentre of pilgrimage. The pilgrims who usually spend between two days and a week here transform the sleepy, impoverished city of 80,000. They throng the streets leading to Nachman’s grave and pay hundreds of dollars for a single bed.\\xa0Less affluent visitors pitch tents next to apartment buildings or garages. Cafeterias and fast food joints along their way display signs in Hebrew and promise kosher food and drink, while Israeli authorities and charities provide refreshments free of charge. The pilgrims sport white or black robes, curly or braided sidelocks and long beards, and their skullcaps or shiny fur hats contrast the casual attire of the Ukrainian locals. On Saturday, the day when they abstain from anything unrelated to religion, they left empty coffee cups and plastic plates on the ground and tables.\\xa0They loudly conversed and prayed in Hebrew and Yiddish, looking jubilant and breaking into cheerful chants. Their self-confident strides occasionally made locals step aside with some whispering obscenities or anti-Semitic slurs. “Our mentalities differ,” admitted Boris, 28, a burly Jewish-Ukrainian volunteer who knows Hebrew and helps Uman police and residents mediate conflicts with the pilgrims. “It’s hard for police without us because they don’t speak Hebrew or English,” he said. Most Uman residents welcome the Hasidim and the influx of cash they bring to Ukraine, one of Europe’s poorest nations whose economy shrank by one-third because of the war. “There are [negative] moments but they are compensated by a chance to earn money,” Aleks Melnik, who lives on Pushkin Street, told Al Jazeera. He is far more unhappy about tough security measures in Uman, Ukraine’s endemic corruption, and the non-transparent ways authorities spend the obligatory $200 payments from each pilgrim. Melnik, 42, said he has to show his identification card to police officers guarding the street, and cannot drive his car there unless he pays a $100 bribe. But over the decades he has befriended many pilgrims and said Ukrainians can take lessons when it comes to devotion to faith or national defence. “We can definitely learn from them,” he said, sitting on a bench less than 50 metres (164 feet) away from Nachman’s grave. The grave site looked like a beehive humming with the sound of prayers of hundreds of men shaking their heads and holding religious books or leaflets. Anti-Semitism used to be rampant in what is now Ukraine. Its most celebrated writer Nikolay Gogol described the casual, totally unprovoked killing of Jewish adults and children by warlike Cossacks. Nobel Prize-winning Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexievich was blacklisted in Ukraine in 2018 for mentioning some anti-Soviet nationalists who sided with Nazi Germans during World War II and participated in the mass killing of Jews. Three hundred years ago, this anti-Semitism – along with the influence of Protestant Christianity that emphasised a mystical and personal connection to God – spurred the emergence of Hasidism among the world’s largest population of Ashkenazim, or Eastern European Jews. Hasidic communities are still centred around “dynasties” of rabbis, and only Nachman’s followers are known as “dead Hasidim” because he never named a successor. The lifestyle of Rabbi Nachman and his followers confined to the Pale of Settlement in the western part of the Russian Empire could not be more different from that of their rulers. Nachman died in Uman of tuberculosis when he was only 38 – at a time when a local aristocrat completed a giant park with marble statues, artificial lakes, and grottoes for his wife, a former courtesan he bought for two million golden coins. Nachman’s teachings were quickly accepted by many Ashkenazim, and these days his followers include Jews of Middle Eastern or Ethiopian origin – some of whom were seen in Uman. The city has seen its share of pogroms that forced millions of Jews to leave for the United States and, later, British-controlled Palestine. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and some of his cabinet members hail from Jewish families, and his government has tried to rein in ultranationalists who occasionally espouse anti-Semitism. On Friday night, the pilgrims held a collective prayer for peace in Ukraine, and some urged Zelenskyy to visit the grave so Nachman helps Kyiv win the war against the Russian invaders. “Come here and beseech God and I assure you, as does Rabbi Nachman — victory will be yours,” one of the pilgrims reportedly said.

       "  'Date': '16 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Russia has said its forces remained in control of villages near the shattered city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, denying a Ukrainian claim that their own troops had liberated the front-line village of Andriivka. On Saturday, Russia dismissed Ukrainian allegations that its forces had been pushed out of Andriivka. This came after the commander of Ukraine’s land forces posted a video purporting to show the capture of Andriivka amid a landscape of scorched territory and devastation. The video shows Ukrainian soldiers advancing on empty devastated ground marked by the burned remnants of trees and taking cover in the shattered hulks of buildings reduced to rubble. Another video showed trucks driving at high speed down a deserted road. Andriivka is around 14km (9 miles) south of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, where Kyiv has been pushing back against Moscow’s forces since June. But in its daily bulletin, Russia’s defence ministry said that “the enemy… continues to carry out assaults … trying in vain to dislodge Russian troops in the localities of Andriivka and Klishchiivka”. The statement adds to the confusion surrounding the situation on the ground in the village, which had just a few dozen residents before Russia’s offensive. The account of fighting by Russia’s defence ministry said its troops were still holding at least two key villages south of Bakhmut, known in Russia by its Soviet-era name, Artyomovsk. “The enemy did not abandon plans to capture the city of Artyomovsk of the Donetsk People’s Republic and continued to conduct assault operations … unsuccessfully trying to oust Russian troops from the population centres of Klishchiivka and Andriivka,” the ministry said in its daily briefing. The report said Russian forces had, in the past week, repelled 16 Ukrainian attacks, with enemy losses at more than 1,700 dead and wounded, along with 16 tanks.      On Thursday, Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Mailar had to backtrack on an announcement earlier that day that Kyiv had retaken Andriivka, after troops there said fighting was still going on. Then on Ukrainian television Friday, a spokesperson for a brigade fighting in the area said the village had been “completely destroyed”, adding that “Andriivka no longer exists”. In the east and the south, Ukraine has been reporting minimal territorial gains after months of intense fighting and heavy losses. Despite being bolstered by NATO-standard weapons worth billions of dollars, Ukrainian military officials have said there are no quick solutions to puncture Russian defensive lines — only slow, grinding battles. Ukraine’s strategy appears to be to spread Russian forces thin across multiple directions along the front line, from vast agricultural tracts in the east to the Dnipro River, which marks the line of contact in the south, in hopes that Ukrainian troops can exploit their opponents’ vulnerabilities. The wet weather of fall and winter will likely slow Ukrainian advances. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to visit Washington next week as Congress debates approving more aid.

       "  'Date': '15 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Farmers in countries neighbouring Ukraine have repeatedly complained about a product glut hitting their domestic prices. Poland, Slovakia and Hungary will impose their own restrictions on Ukrainian grain imports, the governments said after the European Commission decided not to extend a ban affecting Ukraine’s five EU neighbours. Restrictions imposed by the European Union in May allowed Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia to ban domestic sales of Ukrainian wheat, maize, rapeseed and sunflower seeds while permitting transit of such cargoes for export elsewhere. “We will extend this ban despite their disagreement, despite the European Commission’s disagreement,” Polish PM Mateusz Morawiecki told a rally in the northeastern town of Elk on Friday. “We will do it because it is in the interest of the Polish farmer.” Hungary imposed a national import ban on 24 Ukrainian agricultural products, including grains, vegetables, several meat products and honey, according to a government decree published on Friday. Slovakia’s agriculture minister followed suit announcing his country’s own grain ban. All three bans only apply to domestic imports and do not affect transit to onward markets. The EU created alternative land routes, so-called Solidarity Lanes, for Ukraine to use to export its grains and oilseeds after Russia backed out of the UN-brokered Black Sea grain deal in July that allowed safe passage for the cargo ships.      The European Commission said existing measures would expire as originally planned on Friday after Ukraine agreed to introduce any legal measures within 30 days to avoid grain surges. “It has concluded that thanks to the work of the Coordination Platform and to the temporary measures introduced on 2 May 2023, the market distortions in the 5 Member States bordering Ukraine have disappeared,” the European Commission said in a statement. The EU said it would refrain from imposing any restrictions as long as the effective measures by Ukraine are in place and fully working. Farmers in the five countries neighbouring Ukraine have repeatedly complained about a product glut hitting their domestic prices and pushing them towards bankruptcy. The countries, except Bulgaria, had been pushing for an extension of the ban passed its September 15 expiry. Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania previously said they may extend the restrictions unilaterally while Bulgaria on Thursday voted to scrap the curbs. Romania’s government, which unlike its peers did not unilaterally enforce a ban before May, said on Friday it “regretted that a European solution to extend the ban could not be found”. It added it was waiting for Ukraine to present its action plan of measures to prevent an import surge by September 18 before deciding how to protect Romanian farmers. Romania sees over 60 percent of the alternate flows pass through its territory mainly via the Danube River and its farmers have threatened protests if the ban is not extended. For the last year, Ukraine had been moving 60 percent of its exports through the Solidarity Lanes and 40 percent via the Black Sea thanks to the deal. In August, about four million tonnes of Ukraine grains passed through the Solidarity Lanes of which close to 2.7 million tonnes were through the Danube. The Commission wants to increase exports through Romania further but the plan has been complicated by Russian drone attacks on Ukraine’s grain infrastructure along the Danube and near the Romanian border.

       "  'Date': '15 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The third rate hike in two months comes as Russia grapples with higher inflation and a weaker rouble. Russia’s central bank has raised its key interest rate by 100 basis points to 13 percent, hiking the cost of borrowing for the third time in two months as it grapples with higher inflation and a weaker rouble. Inflation in Russia accelerated in recent months and has remained stubbornly high, with the central bank failing to meet its target of four percent. The central bank said on Friday its board of directors decided to increase the key rate from 12 percent to 13 percent. “Inflationary pressure in the Russian economy remains high,” the bank said in a statement. The bank also pointed to the “depreciation of the rouble”, which has shed about 30 percent of its value against the US dollar since the start of the year. “The Bank of Russia will assess the feasibility of further increases of the key rate at its upcoming meetings,” it said. The central bank adjusted its year-end forecast for inflation to 6.0-7.0 percent from 5.0-6.5 percent. Annual inflation was running at 5.33 percent as of September 11, above the 4 percent target. Capital Economics said it was not convinced inflation would return to the bank’s 4 percent target in 2024, and expected more rate hikes to come. “Russia’s central bank is a hawkish institution that takes its commitment to inflation fighting seriously,” Liam Peach, senior emerging markets economist, told Reuters news agency. “With fiscal policy set to remain loose, the economy likely to continue overheating and inflation pressures to build further, there will be more pressure on the central bank to tighten monetary policy,” he added. The central bank last hiked its key rate at an emergency meeting in August, a day after the rouble tumbled to a more than 16-month low against the US dollar. On Tuesday, President Vladimir Putin downplayed the weakening of the currency, which has been weighed down by lower export revenues and higher military spending in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine. “This issue requires its own painstaking research by the central bank and the Russian government and financial authorities,” he said at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. Russian officials have largely shrugged off the economic effects of Moscow’s dragging offensive in Ukraine, despite an exodus of foreign companies and unprecedented Western sanctions.

Kyiv, Ukraine – The very names of suburbs where Marina Krasnolenska sells real estate may make one tear up. Bucha, Irpin, Vorzel and nearby areas north of the Ukrainian capital are where Russian servicemen were accused of killing, wounding, robbing or raping thousands of civilians. Shelling during Moscow’s invasion destroyed or damaged hundreds of buildings, often burying residents alive, and the shock waves made thousands of roofs leaky. Selling property in the area in the months following the withdrawal of Russian troops last year was tricky. Clients asked to find real estate in “undamaged districts”, she told Al Jazeera. “When looking at damaged locations, they said, ‘This smells of death,’” said Krasnolenska, a 45-year-old mother of two who left her hometown Vorzel just before the invaders rolled in. But as infrastructure, roofs, roads and bridges are being rebuilt, customers are no longer repulsed, and homes north of Kyiv, just like almost elsewhere in Ukraine, sell like hot potatoes. “Our region sells very well,” said Krasnolenska, who worked as an estate agent for 20 years. “Prices didn’t go back to pre-war levels, but the market is very much alive. Which is surprising to me too.” Millions of refugees have spilled out of Ukraine, and at least one in three plans to return after the war. Ukraine’s birth rate of 1.22 children per woman is one of the world’s lowest and leaves little hope for post-war repopulation. A million men have been mobilised, leaving their families and jobs, including in construction, while others of conscription age are banned from crossing the border. Last year, Ukraine’s economy shrank by a third, inflation went up by more than a fourth, and only multibillion Western aid pays the bills of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government. But real estate lost value significantly only in eastern and southern areas close to the front lines, while price tags in western regions skyrocketed by up to 75 percent. One of the leaders is Uzhhorod, a picture-perfect city in Ukraine’s west with medieval cathedrals, Europe’s longest linden alley – and the Slovakian border nearby. Housing prices in central Ukraine went down 25-30 percent – but are moving up as the market shows unexpected growth and some developers restart suspended construction projects. One reason is the nationwide habit of stashing thick wads of cash in US dollars or euros. Despite dwindling income, Ukrainians keep about $25bn in banks and between $60bn and $100bn outside them, said Denis Sudilkovskiy, marketing director of the LUN real estate agency in Kyiv. “A significant part of the population has not lost the capability and the very idea of owning their own home,” he told Al Jazeera. The boom follows a freeze. After the war began on February 24, 2022, authorities stopped registering real estate deals for more than six months. When the freeze was over, sales stalled, and rent rates plummeted. But as Russian forces withdrew or were kicked out of large areas in the east and south, many rushed to buy new homes. “I would call it a syndrome of delayed happiness,” Krasnolenska said. “Each person has plans to buy a house or an apartment. And this desire grew into good demand, because people are tired of waiting.” The war also continued an old trend. More than two-thirds of Ukrainians are urbanites living in apartment buildings with central heating, water and power supply. But many cherish memories of their grandparents’ village houses – and a chance to draw water from a well, tend a garden or taste a homegrown pear. Even before the war and the COVID-19 pandemic, it was a nationwide obsession – eight in 10 Ukrainians wanted to live in a house instead of an apartment, according to a 2013 poll. The trend seems to have gotten stronger after last October, when Moscow began launching missiles and drones to destroy civilian infrastructure, especially power and central heating stations. Millions lived through blackouts and disruption of water and heat supply that sometimes lasted for days amid freezing winter temperatures. “Sometimes, we went to my father’s country house just to warm up, go to a sauna and sleep in warmth,” Natalya Roslavets, an embroidery artist from northern Kyiv, told Al Jazeera describing a spacious house with a wood furnace and a diesel generator. For many middle-class Ukrainians, the dream is a townhouse with a water well, a power generator and even solar panels, and a patch of land big enough for a kitchen garden, a children’s playground and a barbecue. “Considering the war, sales are excellent,” Maksym Kryachek, whose construction company is building 21 two-storey townhouses in eastern Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. Each sells for $75,000, the price of a two-bedroom apartment in an uptown district, and most have already been snapped up. “People don’t want to live in apartments, they see that for the same money, they can have parking, a backdoor garden, and more space,” he said. The first buyer has already finished the renovation and moved in. Once completed, the community will be gated – and its residents will live next to a lake, a bus stop and a private preschool. “You can sit there and flip [the Russians] off,” Kryachek’s business partner Vladyslav Cherniienko told Al Jazeera. The area, called Osokorki (Black Poplars), is textbook suburbia with pristine air and not a single apartment building in sight. The nearest subway station is only 4km (2.5 miles) away – and is reachable by public transport. Much closer is the Dnipro, one of Europe’s largest rivers. Vikings built Kyiv on the hills of its right bank more than 12 centuries ago, and the left bank was flooded each spring until a giant dam upriver was built in the mid-1960s. Still studded with small lakes and canals, the neighbourhood mostly consisted of Soviet-era wooden dachas with potato patches and orchids. These days, increasingly luxurious houses mushroom in Osokorki and other suburbs – along with shops, schools, kindergartens, health clinics and barely a thing that reminds of the ongoing war. “Any Kyiv suburb has become more suitable for life in the past 20 years,” Cherniienko said. Kryachek thinks that property remains the only tool of investment as there is no functioning bonds market, and most Ukrainians understand little about cryptocurrencies. Many factors keep prices high. The National Bank of Ukraine predicted in January a “deficit of supply on the housing market” because many developers opt out of new projects. The underdeveloped mortgage market boasts two-digit interest rates and can offer little to Ukrainians who cannot afford to pay for housing at once. Mere thousands became part of a government programme that offered interest rates of 3 to 7 percent to servicemen, teachers and health professionals. Millions who fled areas under occupation or next to the front lines predictably flocked to central and western cities. Many plants churning out construction materials have been destroyed or face problems with qualified staffers, logistics and raw materials. There is a shortage of construction workers who mostly hail from western Ukraine and often do not want to work in central and eastern regions that face frequent shelling. After the war and amid a potential construction boom, developers may consider employing workers who migrate from eastern Ukrainian regions, Asia and even Eastern Europe, LUN agency’s Sudilkovskiy predicted. This would spike short-term prices, another expert said. “In Kyiv, real estate prices will keep growing, mostly rent, and housing to a lesser extent,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. However, Ukraine’s wartime and post-war economic future is far from optimistic, and in the long-term perspective, the market will “see a long stagnation and occasional defaults of developers”, he said.

       "  'Date': '15 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Russian drone debris found in Romanian territory as Moscow increases drone attacks on Ukraine’s Danube river ports. Romania has imposed additional flight restrictions in parts of its air space along the Ukrainian border as Russian attacks on Ukraine’s Danube river ports have intensified fears of a spillover on nearby Romanian territory. Drone debris following Russian attacks on Ukraine’s Danube river ports has been found in Romania – a NATO member – underlining security risks for the military alliance, whose members have a mutual defence commitment. An order from the Romanian defence ministry on Thursday banned piloted and unmanned aircraft from flying within 30km (19 miles) of the border with Ukraine at an altitude of less than 4,000 metres (more than 13,000 ft). Romania already imposed an 8km (almost 5 miles) border exclusion zone for flights of less than 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) in places since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.      Romania and Ukraine share a border of more than 100km (62 miles) along the Danube at a point where the river nears the Black Sea. Romania’s defence ministry said it had enforced the additional restrictions between its Danube river ports of Sulina and Galati because of Russia’s attacks nearby. “Given the intensifying Russian attacks on Ukraine’s river ports, measures to extend restrictions were necessary to ensure a more efficient monitoring and control of air space,” the ministry said. Romania’s foreign ministry has twice summoned the Russian charge d’affaires following the discovery on Romanian soil of drone debris. The defence ministry said it would deploy additional troops to southeastern Romania near the border with Ukraine and increase patrols and observation points, in an effort to prevent risks to residents. Russian attacks on Ukraine’s river ports across the Danube from Romania have increased since mid-July when Moscow abandoned a year-old deal that lifted a Russian blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports.      NATO has said Russian air attacks near the border were “destabilising” even if there was no indication that Russia intended to hit a NATO member. Ukraine is one of the world’s biggest grain exporters and the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta is now Kyiv’s largest alternative export route, with grains arriving by road, rail or barge across the Danube from ports that are coming under attack from Moscow.

       "  'Text': 'Russian S-400 ‘Triumf’ surface-to-air missile defence system was reportedly destroyed in ‘special operation’ in Russian-annexed Crimea. Ukraine said its forces attacked two Russian patrol ships operating in the Black Sea and destroyed a sophisticated “Triumf” surface-to-air missile defence system in Russian-occupied Crimea, with military analysts describing the loss of such equipment as “tactical failures” by Russia. The attacks reported on Thursday followed a day after Kyiv said it had carried out a missile strike that badly damaged a Russian submarine and a naval landing ship that were undergoing repairs in a shipyard in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. In a post on the Telegram messaging app on Thursday, Ukraine’s military said it hit two Russian patrol vessels in a southwest region of the Black Sea, causing “certain damage” in a morning attack. “The [Sergei] Kotov was hit,” military intelligence official Andriy Yusov told the Reuters news agency, sharing a grainy video circulated online by a Ukrainian government minister that appeared to show sea drones attacking a vessel at sea. Footage of a maritime drone attack on a Russian warship, presumably the \"Vasily Bykov\", has appeared. pic.twitter.com/6L3LDLrY3P — NEXTA (@nexta_tv) September 14, 2023  The Russian Defence Ministry confirmed an attack on the Sergei Kotov ship in a morning statement but said the assault involving five sea drones was repelled. It made no mention of damage. Ukraine’s military also said it had hit a Russian air defence system in a long-range attack in the early hours of Thursday near the town of Yevpatoriya in the west of Crimea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made special reference to the Crimea attack in his nightly message to the nation on Thursday. “I thank you for today’s triumph – the destruction of the occupiers’ air defence system on the land of our Crimea. It is a very significant achievement. Well done!” he said. “The entire staff of the Security Service of Ukraine and our Navy should be specially commended for this.” Today, there are reasons to praise the work of Ukraine’s Security Service, its personnel, and the Ukrainian Navy. I thank them for today’s triumph—destroying the occupant’s air defense system in our Crimea. Very significant outcome! Glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! pic.twitter.com/52o83hpmlq — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) September 14, 2023  A Ukrainian intelligence source said that aerial combat drones first incapacitated the Russian air defence system by attacking its radar and antenna and that two Neptune cruise missiles were fired and had destroyed the defence system’s launchers. Footage circulated on social media showed powerful explosions and a plume of smoke rising in the night sky, illuminated by a blaze. Reuters could not verify the video. Russia’s Defence Ministry said its air defences shot down 11 drones overnight over the peninsula and did not mention damage. Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said on Thursday that the reported destruction of the Russian S-400 “Triumf” surface-to-air missile system based in Crimea in a “special operation” points to serious issues in Russia’s defence of the occupied peninsula. “The strike suggests that Russian forces were unprepared to intercept missiles with the system or were unable to do so,” the ISW said. According to the ISW, Ukrainian forces hit a Russian S-400 air defence system near Olenivka, Crimea, in late August. A “second Ukrainian strike on a significant Russian air defence system in recent weeks indicates that such tactical failures may reflect a wider systemic issue with Russian air defences in occupied Crimea,” the think tank said.

While Kyiv’s counteroffensive in the south and east has been slowed by minefields and Russian defensive lines, Ukrainian forces have escalated attacks in the Black Sea region, where Russia is imposing a de facto blockade on Ukraine’s seaborne exports. Ukraine has increasingly relied on seaborne drones to attack Russian targets, hitting the Olenegorsky Gornyak landing ship near Russia’s naval base at Novorossiysk early last month, as well as a Russian fuel tanker. Ukraine continues to press on with its gruelling counteroffensive with fierce fighting reported in many parts of the front line, but no significant breakthroughs in the three-month-old campaign. \\xa0            Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '14 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'The US Congress is facing a September 30 deadline to pass budget legislation, including further aid for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to visit the seat of the United States government in Washington, DC, next week, as he makes the case for ongoing aid to his war-torn country. Details of the visit started to appear in US media on Thursday afternoon, with anonymous government sources confirming the plans. Zelenskyy is expected to meet with US President Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday, along with a stop at the Capitol. His appearance will coincide with a debate in Congress over federal spending, as lawmakers face an impending September 30 deadline to pass a budget. The Biden administration has asked Congress to allocate a total of $24bn for Ukraine support, including $13.1bn in additional military aid and $8.5bn for humanitarian support. But some politicians, particularly in the Republican Party, have balked at the prospect of sending more money and supplies to Ukraine, as it attempts to repel Russian forces. Congress has already approved aid totalling over $113bn. But the last time the legislature approved funding for Ukraine was in December — before Republicans took control of the House of Representatives.      Now, with a narrow conservative majority in the lower chamber, far-right politicians hold greater sway over how budget legislation is decided. Just last July, 70 House Republicans, led by Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, backed a proposal to cut off security assistance to Ukraine altogether. Next week’s appearance at Capitol Hill will be Zelenskyy’s second since the full-scale invasion of his country began in February 2022. In his first visit, held last December, the Ukrainian president delivered an impassioned speech before Congress, rallying lawmakers against Russian “aggression”. “It is just a matter of time when they will strike against your other allies if we do not stop them now. We must do it,” Zelenskyy told the US Congress. “Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.”      Zelenskyy has made few trips outside his native Ukraine since the invasion, but he is set to be in the US already next week for the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York. His presence was, until recently, uncertain, but experts believe he is attempting to generate support for the Ukrainian war effort by meeting with world leaders in person. Earlier this, Zelenskyy also made surprise visits to the Netherlands and Japan, in a similar effort to drum up backing among global powers. Ukraine is currently in the midst of a challenging, months-long counteroffensive, as it attempts to claw back territory occupied by Russian forces.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '14 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Kim is continuing his tour of eastern Russia after his summit with Putin at the Vostochny Cosmodrome. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accepted an invitation from Kim Jong Un to visit North Korea after the two leaders held their first face-to-face summit in four years. Kim is in Russia’s far east as Putin looks to reinforce alliances amid Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, and as the North Korean leader continues to advance his country’s military modernisation. He extended the invitation to Putin at “a convenient time” at a reception to mark the end of a day where the two held more than four hours of talks and toured the Vostochny Cosmodrome space centre. “Putin accepted the invitation with pleasure and reaffirmed his will to invariably carry forward the history and tradition of the Russia-DPRK friendship,” North Korean state news agency KCNA said on Thursday, using the acronym for the country’s official name. The talks in Russia have raised concern in the United States and elsewhere that Kim might be prepared to sell arms to Moscow for its war in Ukraine, perhaps in exchange for technology that would further his military ambitions.      The North Korean leader is also expected to visit an aircraft factory and travel to Vladivostok where he will view Russia’s Pacific fleet. Kim’s delegation includes his defence minister, his top military commander and the director of the country’s munitions department. Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said the members of Kim’s delegation, as well as the location for the summit, were “quite telling” even though no joint statement was issued. “The composition of Kim’s delegation suggests North Korea may send munitions to Russia in exchange for military technology. Meeting at Russia’s eastern spaceport was equivalent to Putin thumbing his nose at UN Security Council Resolutions,” Easley said in emailed comments. “This should be a wake-up call to all other UN member states about the need to redouble efforts at enforcing sanctions on Pyongyang.” In its report, KCNA said the two leaders agreed to further strengthen strategic and tactical cooperation in the face of the “military threats, provocations and tyranny of imperialists”. Putin, meanwhile, praised the “strengthening of cooperation and friendship between our countries” and told reporters he saw “possibilities” for military cooperation with North Korea. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, who was a guest of honour at events to mark the 70th anniversary of the armistice that ended the fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War, in Pyongyang in July, was also involved in the talks. The Russian leader said earlier that Moscow could help Pyongyang build satellites – Kim has argued a spy satellite is crucial for North Korea’s weapons development but its two attempts this year to put one into orbit have both ended in failure. Some analysts suggested North Korea might want to try using a Russian space launch vehicle for the satellite and work with Russia to build a more powerful piece of equipment. “It’s possible that North Korea pushes to participate in the production process of the satellite, rather than just acquiring a finished product, to set up a natural transfer of technologies,”\\xa0Yang Uk, a military expert at South Korea’s Asian Institute for Policy Studies, told the Associated Press news agency. Just before Putin and Kim met, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles, the latest in a series of launches in breach of United Nations sanctions that prohibit such activities. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said it was “troubling” that Russia was talking about cooperation with North Korea on programmes that potentially would violate UN Security Council resolutions. South Korea’s unification minister, Kim Young-ho, who is in charge of relations with Pyongyang, expressed “deep concerns” over military cooperation and possible arms deals, saying the two countries were apparently continuing to pursue “some kind of” a military deal. “We once again urge Russia and North Korea to halt illicit acts that cause their isolation and regression, and follow international rules including the Security Council resolutions,” the minister told reporters on Thursday. Japan’s newly-appointed Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa also warned against “violations” of UN resolutions. The resolutions – passed with Russian support – ban the development of technology that could be used in North Korea’s ballistic missile programmes. They also prohibit any scientific and technical cooperation with North Korea in nuclear science and technology, aerospace and aeronautical engineering and technology, or advanced manufacturing production techniques and methods.

       "  'Text': 'US says it ‘won’t hesitate’ to impose more sanctions on Russia and North Korea if they conclude any new arms deal. A rare meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin has been met with warnings from Western nations who suspect an arms deal may be imminent. The United States and the United Kingdom have expressed concerns that Kim could provide weapons and ammunition to Russia, which has expended vast stocks in more than 18 months of war in Ukraine. Moscow and Pyongyang have denied such intentions. The US Department of State said on Wednesday that US President Joe Biden’s administration “won’t hesitate” to impose more sanctions on Russia and North Korea if they conclude any new arms deals. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller issued the warning at a briefing in response to questions about the meeting in Russia between Putin and Kim. “We have taken a number of actions already to sanction entities that brokered arms sales between North\\xa0Korea\\xa0and Russia and we won’t hesitate to impose additional actions if appropriate,” Miller said. It was troubling that Russia and North Korea were discussing increased cooperation that could violate UN Security Council resolutions, he said. “When you see what looks to be increased cooperation and probably military transfers, that is quite troubling and would potentially be in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions,” Miller said. James O’Brien, head of the Office of Sanctions Coordination, told The Associated Press news agency such a deal would trigger a US attempt to identify the individuals involved and the financial mechanisms they used to “at least limit their ability to be effective”. “Russia is scraping the bottom of the barrel looking for help because it’s having trouble sustaining its military,” he said. “Russia is now overtly engaging with a country that the UN has sanctioned. And that’s very problematic for Russia’s global position.” During the meeting, which lasted more than four hours at Russia’s Vostochny Cosmodrome, Putin showed Kim around the advanced space rocket launch site, and discussed the possibility of sending a North Korean cosmonaut into space. Kim, who arrived by train from North Korea, asked detailed questions about rockets as the two leaders toured the site in Russia’s east. When asked by Russian media, who were given significant access at the summit, if Russia would help Kim build satellites, Putin said, “That’s why we came here.” Across the Atlantic, the United Kingdom also urged North Korea to end arms talks with Russia and said Kim’s visit showed how isolated Moscow had become on the world stage. “We urge the DPRK to cease its arms negotiations with Russia and to abide by public commitments Pyongyang has made not to sell arms to Russia,” Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson told reporters, referring to North Korea by its official name.      “This visit serves to highlight Russia’s isolation on the global stage, and as the world unites against Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and he has been forced to turn to regimes such as North Korea.” Putin gave numerous hints that military cooperation was discussed but disclosed few details. Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu attended the talks. The Kremlin said sensitive discussions between neighbours were a private matter. During a news briefing on Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also signalled that Moscow had to tread carefully. “Any form of cooperation of any country with North Korea must respect the sanctions regime that was imposed by the Security Council,” Guterres told reporters, adding that it was “extremely relevant” in the case of Russia and North Korea. Reporting from Seoul, Al Jazeera’s Florence Looi said it was significant that Kim had chosen Putin to be the first foreign leader that he has met since the pandemic. Looi also explained what North Korea and Russia’s closer ties will look like after the meeting between the two leaders. “North Korea is one of the few countries to publicly support Russia in its invasion and war in Ukraine. Now, Kim has stated that he considers this war a righteous endeavour, and he also said that North Korea is ready to stand with Russia, against imperialism,” Looi said. The two leaders called each other “comrades” at lunch and Putin repeatedly reminded Kim that it was the Soviet Union that backed North Korea – and was first to recognise it just more than 75 years to the day since it was established. Russia has joined China in opposing new sanctions on North Korea, blocking a US-led push and publicly splitting the UN Security Council for the first time since it started punishing Pyongyang in 2006. Asked about military cooperation, Putin said Russia complied with international rules but that there were opportunities to explore.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '13 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Washington could impose more sanctions, but analysts say penalties are unlikely to halt Moscow-Pyongyang alliance. Washington, DC –\\xa0For weeks, the United States has been warning North Korea against providing weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine. But experts say there is little Washington can do to halt cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, particularly as their leaders take steps to strengthen the countries’ relationship. “The US right now doesn’t have any leverage over North Korea,” said Jenny Town, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center, a Washington, DC-based think-tank. “We can impose more sanctions. We can step up interdictions. We can make life more difficult, but we can’t stop it from having equal relations with other countries — especially when we don’t have a relationship with it ourselves.” In a rare meeting on Wednesday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged to help Russian President Vladimir Putin fight against the “hegemonic forces” that threaten Moscow’s security and interests. Kim seldom leaves his country. But he travelled to Vostochny Cosmodrome, a spaceport in Russia’s Far East, this week to visit with Putin for several hours. The two leaders did not make public any arms deals, which would be in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions against North Korea and US sanctions against Russia. But Kim signalled strong backing for the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine without explicitly mentioning the conflict. “The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has always expressed its full and unconditional support for all measures taken by the Russian government,” he said. “And I take this opportunity to reaffirm that we will always stand with Russia on the anti-imperialist front and the front of independence.”      US officials have said Russia is seeking munitions from North Korea, which possesses large stockpiles of Soviet-era ammunition and produces arms domestically. Last week, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said there will be a “price” to pay if the two countries agree to an arms deal. And on Monday, the US Department of State threatened sanctions if North Korea provides weapons to Russia. But North Korea and Russia are already two of the most sanctioned countries in the world. Mark Barry, an independent Asian affairs analyst, said the US can impose more “toothless” sanctions on North Korea, but they would not stop Pyongyang from working with Moscow. He said Russia, North Korea and China are likely to deepen their ties going forward, as Moscow looks to “project an image of solidarity” with its two Asian neighbours. But Washington has repeatedly warned both Beijing and Pyongyang against coming to Russia’s aid in Ukraine. Last year, the US accused North Korea of covertly shipping artillery shells to Russia, an allegation that was denied by both Moscow and Pyongyang. Experts say that, while North Korean weapons could add to Russia’s dwindling firepower in Ukraine, they would not have a decisive impact on the war. “Can North Korean small arms, artillery munitions help prolong Russia’s efforts? Probably. But it’s not going to be a game changer by any means,” Town said. For his part, Barry said an increasingly isolated Putin is mainly pushing to show some geopolitical reach by bolstering ties with North Korea. “Russia is in need of some things from North Korea — although I would argue that the real need is not so much 1950s-era ammunition and artillery shells, but it’s to project the power and influence that they really don’t have,” he said. Barry also noted the logistic difficulty of transferring ammunition across thousands of miles, from North Korea to the Ukrainian front. The transportation alone could take months.      Beyond the Ukraine war, Wednesday’s meeting between Kim and Putin points to a broader, growing alliance between North Korea and Russia that also includes China, according to experts. As the US helps Ukraine against the Russian invasion with billions of dollars in military aid, it is also working to counter North Korea by strengthening security ties\\xa0with Japan and South Korea. Separately, Washington is locked in a strategic competition with Beijing. Town said Moscow, Pyongyang and Beijing may have different agendas, but they are strengthening their partnerships in opposition to what they see as the “reciprocal bloc” of Washington, Seoul and Tokyo in northeast Asia. Meanwhile, tensions have been escalating around the Korean Peninsula as the US continues to hold joint military drills with South Korea and Japan, and North Korea steps up its ballistic missile testing. Earlier this year, North Korea warned of a nuclear confrontation after the US sent a submarine with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles to South Korea. Diplomacy between the US and North Korea has been on ice for years. Former US President Donald Trump held two summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019, but the meetings did not produce longterm, tangible results. The failure of the 2019 meeting in Hanoi — which was cut short by Trump — was particularly jarring to Kim, who had built up expectations among North Koreans that economic relief was imminent, analysts say. North Korea remains under heavy UN and US sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes. Barry said Kim had travelled 65 hours by train to meet with Trump in 2019, but he ultimately left Hanoi with nothing to show. “He was incredibly embarrassed. He lost a lot of face,” Barry explained, adding that the North Korean leader has since given up on the US.      While the administration of US President Joe Biden says Washington is open to dialogue with Pyongyang, any negotiations would focus on North Korea’s nuclear programme, not broader relations. “There’s an arms race going on in Northeast Asia,” Town said. “The idea that North Korea would agree unilaterally in the middle of this arms race … to put controls and limits on its own weapons development is really unrealistic to begin with.” With the “disillusionment” that followed the Hanoi summit, North Korea has entrenched itself more deeply with Russia and China, she added, especially as Moscow deals with its own sanctions. That bloc formation — absent comprehensive diplomacy — could lead to escalation and prolong conflicts, experts say. “It makes everything more difficult. It makes it harder to reach across ideological lines, first of all,” Town said. “It may lead to more emboldened actions if there is more a sense of collective security amongst those three countries.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'NATO says Romania alerted allies of drone fragments resembling Russian models on its territory ‘for a third time’. NATO member Romania has found new fragments of a drone deemed similar to those used by the Russian army near its border with war-torn Ukraine, in the third such finding in a week, defence and NATO officials said. Two helicopters from the Romanian Air Force were deployed with specialist teams to Nufaru and Victoria in the eastern county of Tulcea, where the fragments were spread over “several tens of meters”, the Ministry of National Defense said in a statement. It said in a separate statement that it has notified the General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations about areas near the border that could be at risk of incidents as Russian forces attack Ukraine’s Danube River ports across the river from Romania. In a statement, NATO spokesperson Dylan White said that the Romanian ambassador to the alliance updated allies on “Russia’s continued attacks on Ukrainian port infrastructure near Romania”. He added that “NATO has no information indicating any intentional attack by Russia against Allied territory”. As a NATO member, Romania is party to NATO’s mutual defence agreement. Emergency authorities in Romania have received phone calls “about possible cases of drone impacts” between three localities, including Nufaru, the ministry said. It later confirmed that samples collected from the site were similar to those used by the Russian army and that experts are continuing to establish the circumstances of the incident. The NATO spokesperson said Romania had “informed Allies that fragments of drones similar to those used by Russia have been identified on Romanian territory for a third time”. After Wednesday’s drone findings, Romania’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it “reiterates its firm protest against the violation, once again, of Romania’s airspace” and that it will summon the head of Russia’s diplomatic mission. Wednesday’s findings are the third such discovery on Romanian soil since last Thursday. They come during sustained attacks by Russian forces on Ukraine’s Danube ports as Moscow aims to disrupt Ukraine’s ability to export grain to world markets. In the Danube village of Plauru, opposite Ukraine’s Danube port of Izmail, Romania’s defence ministry has erected prefabricated concrete shelters for residents. They measure 9.6 meters long, 2 meters wide inside, and 1.5 meters high (about 31 feet long, 6.5 feet wide and 5 feet high).  While it is unclear whether Romania has determined where or when the drones were launched, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said of drone fragment findings on Saturday that they were “similar to those used by the Russian army”. Iohannis said it indicated there has been “an absolutely unacceptable violation of the sovereign airspace of Romania, a NATO ally, with real risks to the security of Romanian citizens in the area”. Asked about the previous drone fragment findings, Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said on Wednesday: “No one attacked us, and no one is attacking us.” “Some remains jumped from a drone that was hit by the Ukrainian army. It didn’t have explosives, it didn’t have anything that could harm the citizens,” he said. Last week, Romania’s National Committee for Emergency Situations approved measures allowing authorities to issue localised text message alerts or sound alarms to warn inhabitants “adjacent to the conflict areas” in Ukraine of incidents or potential incidents.

       "  'Date': '13 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Kyiv says it has broken through Russia’s ‘first line of defence’, an assessment Washington agrees with. Ukraine increased the range and effectiveness of its long-distance strikes in the 80th and 81st weeks of war, while evidence mounted that it had breached the Russian first line of defence in the south of the country. Russia’s defence ministry admitted on September 12 that Ukraine had launched 10 cruise missiles and three unmanned surface vehicles against the naval port of Sevastopol in Crimea. “We confirm a large landing vessel and submarine were hit,” Andriy Yusov, Ukraine’s military intelligence spokesperson, told Reuters. It is believed to be the largest attack recorded against the strategically located port. “Sevastopol … represents both a base into which supplies can be sent by ship if necessary and also a naval base which can provide some protection to the Kerch Bridge and a base from which the Russians can present an offensive threat to Ukrainian shipping out of Odesa,” wrote strategy professor Phillips O’Brien on Substack. The Kerch Bridge is Russia’s only land connection to Crimea. “The two work symbiotically to provide the Russians supply and control over Crimea. If one is fully put out of action, the other would be in real trouble.” It appears that Ukraine may have been developing its own long-range cruise missile, and is using it to target Crimea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on August 31 said a Ukrainian-produced long-range weapon successfully hit a target 700km (434 miles) away, without providing details. Geolocated footage the previous day showed an explosion near an electricity substation near Feodosia, a Russian port on the east side of Crimea. That day, the Russian defence ministry said it had intercepted a missile targeting rear positions. A week earlier, Ukraine destroyed a Russian S-400 air defence system in Crimea. Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov later attributed the strike to an unspecified Ukrainian-made missile. Ukraine has also developed its own long-range surface drones. On July 17,\\xa0An explosion disabled the Kerch Bridge. Russian sources blamed naval surface drones.\\xa0Russia’s defence\\xa0ministry claimed to have foiled another Ukrainian attack on the Kerch Bridge on the night of August 11. Drone footage Ukraine released on August 4 showed the prow of a surface drone approaching the Olenegorsky Gornyak, a Ropucha-class Russian landing ship, before going blank at contact range. The ship had been patrolling just outside Novorossiysk – supposedly a safe port to which Russia evacuated much of its Black Sea fleet last year. Western allies have held back on long-range munitions for fear of provoking Russia. The advantage to Ukraine of self-produced weapons is that their use is unrestricted. Ukraine’s ground forces continued to expand and consolidate territorial gains in the south and east of the country during the first fortnight of September. Ukrainian forces continued a flanking manoeuvre to the south the eastern city of Bakhmut, where they have been trying to capture the town of Klishchiivka. They made marginal advances on September 1, and the general staff said they had liberated 2sq km (0.7sq miles) there 10 days later. But it was in the south that the Ukrainian counteroffensive has encountered its greatest success. Some of the best Ukrainian formations have been opening a gap in exhaustively prepared Russian minefields and trenches in western Zaporizhia. Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on September 1 that Ukrainian troops had broken through the Russian “first line of defence”. The United States Defence Intelligence Agency’s head of analysis, Trent Maul, told The Economist he agreed with that assessment. “Their breakthrough on that second defensive belt … is actually pretty considerable,” he said, adding that Ukrainian forces had a “realistic possibility” of breaking through remaining defensive layers by the end of the year. Southern forces commander Oleksandr Tarnavskyi agreed, telling The Guardian he expected less resistance from the second and third lines of defence, because Russian forces had spent 60 percent of their time preparing the first line. “We are now between the first and second defensive lines,” Tarnavskyi said. “In the centre of the offensive, we are now completing the destruction of enemy units that provide cover for the retreat of Russian troops behind their second defensive line.” On August 31, Russian military reporters said Ukrainian forces had reached prepared defensive positions west of Verbove, and four days later geolocated footage showed they had passed Russian defences there. “Ukrainian forces advanced to tree-line positions that are east of the Russian anti-tank ditches and dragon’s teeth obstacles that are a part of a tri-layered defense immediately west of Verbove,” wrote the Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank. Dragon’s teeth are concrete triangles designed to stop tanks. Another branch of the Ukrainian counteroffensive in this area was manoeuvring between Robotyne, which Ukraine recaptured last month, and Novoprokopivka, its next target to the south. Footage released on September 5 showed Ukrainian forces overtaking Russian positions near Robotyne and the following day Russia’s occupation governor in Zaporizhia admitted Robotyne had been abandoned to pursue “more advantageous positions”. At the same time, Ukrainian troops were seen advancing along Russian trench lines toward Verbove. One of the biggest obstacles Ukrainian counteroffensive forces have faced is a dense network of minefields, but a report from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) said the depth of those minefields going forward is unpredictable. Russian forces adapted to early clashes by increasing their minefield depth from the standard 120m (394 feet) to 500m (1,640 feet) – a depth unbreachable by mine-clearing equipment. “The increased depth of the fields means that Russian forces have had insufficient mines to consistently meet this lay down with a density of mines consistent with doctrine,” wrote RUSI. “The result has been improvisation of explosive devices, the diversification of the range of mines ceded, and the decreasing regularity of minefields.” Ukraine’s slow, deliberative approach was designed to save lives and equipment, said the RUSI report, a tactic that raised criticism from some Western observers. The success of the counteroffensive was also beginning to win converts. “NATO needs to lead a rapid re-evaluation of its doctrine now to develop the tactics and doctrine of combined arms on a shoestring,” retired Australian Army Major-General Mick Ryan wrote in Foreign Affairs. “That means, collectively, that the states of the West have to find a way to conduct ground combat in an environment where they will be subject to frequent air attacks – something they have not had to do in generations, but that Ukraine must do now.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'The pair were expected to discuss arms deals as the Ukraine war rages. Their public comments signal deep ties. A meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who rarely travels outside his country, and President Vladimir Putin in Russia lasted about five hours and wrapped up on Wednesday, Russian media outlets have reported. The pair, arguably the world’s most isolated leaders, had not met since 2019. They hailed one another as Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine continues, lauding their “comradeship” as Western sanctions against both of their nations persist. The two leaders met at Russia’s most important satellite launch centre, the Vostochny Cosmodrome. North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast, just an hour before Kim met Putin. Asked whether the two leaders would talk about obtaining supplies from North Korea to replenish Moscow’s dwindling stock of weapons and ammunition, Putin said they would discuss “all issues”. Washington and its allies believe defence cooperation was the priority of the meeting; speculation about military cooperation grew after Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu visited North Korea in July. Here’s what they have said so far about the talks, in public remarks: The pair would discuss “all issues”, Putin said, when asked if the two leaders would talk about getting supplies from North Korea. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, commenting on media speculation about a possible weapons exchange, said the West had breached many contractual obligations by sending Soviet-era weaponry to Ukraine, Reuters news agency reported. Kim did not openly speak about a possible weapons deal, which is the subject of intense scrutiny and fear in the Asia Pacific and West. The White House warned last week that North Korea would “pay a price” if it supplied Russia with weaponry for the conflict in Ukraine. Kim promised support for Russia’s “just fight”, backing Moscow’s efforts to defend its interests. The comment was viewed as an apparent reference to the war in Ukraine. “Russia is currently engaged in a just fight against hegemonic forces to defend its sovereign rights, security and interests. I take this opportunity to affirm that we will always stand with Russia on the anti-imperialist front and the front of independence. “We believe with certainty that the Russian army and people will achieve a great victory in the just fight to punish the evil forces pursuing hegemonic and expansionary ambitions and create a stable environment for national development.” Putin welcomed Kim to the cosmodrome, saying: “Dear Mr Chairman, I am very glad to see and welcome you again in Russia – this time, as we agreed, at our Vostochny Cosmodrome. “We are proud of how this sector is developing here, and this is our new facility. I hope both you and your colleagues find this interesting. “We, of course, need to talk about questions of economic cooperation and questions of a humanitarian nature. We have a lot of questions. I want to say that I am very glad to see you. Thank you for accepting the invitation and coming to Russia.” Kim replied, “I express my gratitude to you for paying such attention to our visit to Russia. “We were also able to see with our own eyes the present and future of Russia in the construction of a space power. And we are holding a meeting with you at a very special time, right in the heart of a space power, Russia. “As you said, the Soviet Union played a very big role in the liberation of our country, as well as in the independence of our state, and our friendship has deep roots. And now, relations with the Russian Federation are the very first priority for our country. I am sure that our meeting will be the next step to take relations to a new level. “Now Russia has risen to the sacred fight to protect its sovereignty and security against the hegemonic forces that oppose Russia. And now we want to further develop the relationship. “We will always support the decisions of President Putin and the Russian leadership … I also hope that we will always be together in the fight against imperialism and for the construction of a sovereign state.”      While Putin said the “leader of the DPRK [North Korea] shows great interest in rocket engineering; they are also trying to develop space”, Kim was quoted as saying. He said he found it an “honour” to meet at the launch station, while he lauded Russia as a “space superpower”. “The glory to Russia, which gave birth to the first space conquerors, will be immortal,” Kim said.

       "  'Text': 'Moscow-installed governor reports at least 24 injured as missile attack sparks large blaze at Sevastopol naval shipyard. At least 24 people have been injured and two Russian navy ships engulfed in flames following a Ukrainian missile attack on a shipyard in Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea, authorities said. Sevastopol’s Russia-installed governor, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine carried out the missile attack in the early hours of Wednesday, and Russian air defences attempted to repel the incoming projectiles. Russian ships at sea had also repelled a sea-borne drone attack. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said later that Ukrainian forces launched 10 cruise missiles at the shipyard and three unmanned sea drones at Russian ships in the Black Sea. Seven missiles were shot down and the sea drones were destroyed, the ministry said, but some of the missiles damaged two ships that were being repaired at a shipyard in Sevastopol. “The Ukrainian armed forces launched a strike with 10 cruise missiles at the S. Ordzhonikidze ship repair plant,” the Russian Defence Ministry said on Telegram. “As a result of being hit by enemy cruise missiles, two ships undergoing repairs were damaged,” the ministry said. Sevastopol is the largest city in Crimea and a major port where the Russian Black Sea Fleet is based. Ukraine’s Kyiv Independent news outlet said the attack took place at approximately 3am local time (00:00 GMT). ⚡️Explosions reported near occupied Sevastopol. Photos and videos posted to Telegram on Sept. 13 appeared to show an explosion around Sevastopol, a major naval city in Russian-occupied Crimea. The blasts were reported around 3 a.m. local time. Photo: Crimeanwind/Telegram pic.twitter.com/dwIZBXFlcg — The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) September 13, 2023  Kyiv officials have promised to retake Crimea from Russian control and Ukraine has stepped up air and sea attacks on the peninsula in recent weeks. Several Russian Telegram news monitoring channels reported that the shipyard, which carries out construction and repair on the ships and submarines of the Black Sea Fleet, was on fire. The size of the fire and scale of damage at the shipyard was not immediately known, though images posted on social media showed large flames in the darkness engulfing what seemed to be port infrastructure. Russian Telegram channels posted videos and more photos of sizeable flames at a facility bordering water. Also on Wednesday morning, a Russian drone attack on the Danube River port of Izmail, in Ukraine’s Odesa region, caused a fire and civilian injuries, the regional governor said. Ukraine’s military said 32 Russian drones were shot down during the attack. “Several groups of strike drones were directed to the Izmail district,” Odesa Governor Oleg Kiper said on Telegram, describing the Russian air raid on the civilian port as the action of “terrorists”. “Damage to port and other civil infrastructure was recorded … rescuers are putting out the fire,” Kiper said, adding that six civilians were injured and taken to hospital, with three in a serious condition and three others in “moderate condition”. Located on the border with Romania, Ukraine’s Danube River ports have become a key export route for Ukrainian agricultural products following Russia’s withdrawal from a United Nations-brokered grain deal in July and Moscow’s renewed blockade of the country’s Black Sea ports.

       "  'Text': 'Putin hailing of tech billionaire as ‘outstanding’ follows Musk’s revelation that he thwarted a Ukrainian military operation against Russia’s Black Sea fleet in Russian-annexed Crimea. Russian President Vladimir Putin has hailed tech billionaire Elon Musk as an “outstanding person” and businessman whose SpaceX company has become a key player in the space transportation industry. Putin’s public praise of Musk on Tuesday comes days after the South African-born and United States-based entrepreneur said he refused a Ukrainian request last year to activate his Starlink satellite communication network in the Russian-annexed Crimean port city of Sevastopol to aid an attack on Russia’s Black Sea fleet, saying he feared complicity in a “major” act of war. Putin, speaking at an economic forum in Russia’s Far East, did not refer to the Starlink controversy. But when asked about the success of Musk’s SpaceX company in launching rockets into space, he was full of praise. “As far as private business and Elon Musk is concerned… he is undoubtedly an outstanding person. This must be recognised, and I think it is recognised all over the world,” Putin said. “He [Musk] is an active and talented businessman and he is succeeding a lot, including with the support of the American state,” he added.      Putin also offered a defence of former US President Donald Trump and the multiple criminal cases that he is facing. The charges against Trump show the “rottenness of the American political system”, Putin said at the forum. “What is happening with Trump is a persecution of a political rival for political motives.” Trump is facing several separate criminal cases in the US, including being charged in federal court in Washington, DC with attempted election fraud over his alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. In a Georgia state court, he is charged with election interference and in federal court in Florida, he faces charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.      \\xa0 Earlier this month, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, one of the most hawkish voices in the Kremlin when it comes to Ukraine and the potential for a widening conflict with the West, also took to the Musk-owned X social media platform, previously known as Twitter, to praise Musk’s actions regarding Starlink, Crimea and Ukraine’s forces. Medvedev described Musk as “the last adequate mind in North America”. Ukrainian officials have criticised Musk’s decision to protect the Russian fleet from attack by Ukraine and US Democratic Party Senator Elizabeth Warren has called for an investigation of Musk’s actions. The US Congress should investigate “whether we have adequate tools to make sure foreign policy is conducted by the government and not by one billionaire”, Warren said on Monday, according to the Bloomberg news agency. Musk’s SpaceX firm won a contract from the US Department of Defense to provide Ukraine with Starlink satellite communication services. Russia, which seized the strategic Crimean Peninsula in 2014 from Ukraine, bases its Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol and has used the fleet to blockade Ukrainian ports since its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. The Russian fleet also fires cruise missiles at Ukrainian civilian targets. Kyiv has launched attacks on Russian ships using maritime drones. In a post on X last week, Musk said he had no choice but to reject an emergency request from Ukraine “to activate Starlink all the way to Sevastopol”. Musk did not give the date of the request and the excerpt did not specify it. Much appreciated, Walter. The onus is meaningfully different if I refused to act upon a request from Ukraine vs. made a deliberate change to Starlink to thwart Ukraine.  At no point did I or anyone at SpaceX promise coverage over Crimea. Moreover, our terms of service clearly… https://t.co/jmNtScM5LY — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 9, 2023  “The obvious intent being to sink most of the Russian fleet at anchor,” Musk wrote. “If I had agreed to their request, then SpaceX would be explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Text': 'China is North Korea’s and Russia’s biggest trade partner and has influence that could prevent North Korean munitions being used in Ukraine. China is the key to restraining a potential arms deal between Moscow and Pyongyang, an expert on North Korean military and politics has said as Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un appear poised to meet for talks in Russia’s Far East. Kim arrived onboard his armoured train at the Russian border on Tuesday morning, crossing the frontier at Russia’s Khasan city en route to the meeting where the Russian leader is expected to seek access to stockpiles of North Korean ammunition, which Moscow badly needs to feed its war in Ukraine. The two leaders find themselves in changed circumstances since they last met in 2019, said Fyodor Tertitskiy, a historian of North Korea and leading researcher at Kookmin University’s Institute for Korean Studies in South Korea’s capital Seoul. Both leaders have items to trade, advantages to gain and pressures at home that might encourage them to align their strategic interests more closely when they meet in Russia. However, any agreement will be an “alliance of convenience” and one in which China – being the largest trading partner as well as Moscow and Pyongyang’s most powerful political patron – will tacitly have great influence in deciding the outcome, Tertitskiy said.      “The relationship between these two nations is based on lots of deception and rhetoric,” Tertitskiy told Al Jazeera, contextualising the current state of relations between Russia and North Korea. While North Korea’s Western-facing media output may take a strong stance in support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the media North Koreans consume has remained silent on the war, Tertitskiy said. Many North Koreans may not even know that Russia has invaded its neighbour, he said. A fact not to be overlooked is that while the Soviet Union was an ally of North Korea, Russia is not, and Moscow’s approach to Pyongyang for many years has largely been to support China’s approach, Tertitskiy said. That has involved Moscow backing international sanctions on North Korea, which China supports, and refraining from supporting those Beijing does not back. While Putin’s meeting with Kim in Vladivostok in 2019 resulted in little – and their imminent meeting this week might follow a formula of smiles, mutual condemnations of the West and no follow-ups – conditions internationally and domestically have changed for both since 2022, Tertitskiy said.      Putin’s army needs a supply of millions of artillery shells to continue with its city-flattening tactics in Ukraine. Kim controls a vast domestic arms industry that produces munitions – artillery and rockets – compatible with Soviet-era weaponry still used by Russian forces. Similar to Putin, Kim is in dire straits at home. North Koreans are suffering serious food shortages, the economy needs commodities and fuel to keep going, and Kim wants hard currencies as well as access to the latest military technology to continue his plans for military modernisation, building more powerful intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), developing nuclear-armed attack submarines\\xa0and launching a satellite. Few could miss the symbolism should reports prove correct that the two leaders might hold their summit at Russia’s Vostochny Cosmodrome space centre in the Amur region. That Putin and Kim can satisfy one another’s strategic interest is of concern beyond the war in Ukraine, said Daniel Salisbury, a visiting research fellow at King’s College London. “North Korea desperately wants commodities such as food, oil, fertiliser and other goods,” Salisbury recently wrote in the academic news site, The Conversation.      On the other hand, Russia has “a vast military, nuclear and missile industrial complex, which…could provide Pyongyang much-needed technological fruits,” he said. “If Moscow does move towards becoming a regular customer for embargoed North Korean arms, it will help Putin sustain his illegal war on Ukraine. But the potential technological payoff for Pyongyang could pose longer-term hazards for the world and must also be considered,” he said. Last week, United Nations National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned North Korea that it would “pay a price” if it provided weapons to Russia, without going into detail on his threat. On Monday, the US State Department put more shape to those warnings, saying that any agreement between Kim and Putin on the trade in arms would be met with even more sanctions as a deal would violate United Nations Security Council resolutions. When asked at a press briefing how many entities remained in North Korea that did not have US sanctions already imposed on them, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said he was unable to answer. While the question may have sounded a little sardonic, Miller’s answer was not. North Korea has been subject to stringent UN sanctions for years due to its ongoing tests of ever more powerful ballistic missiles as well as efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Russia has also been subjected to rounds of sanctions since its invasion of Ukraine but has nevertheless continued on with its war.      Ankit Panda, an expert on North Korea’s weapons programme, lightly satirised US efforts to influence North Korea’s actions through such warnings on social media last week. “I suppose there are as-yet-untried adjectives with which we could pepper our sternly worded unilateral and joint press releases,” Panda wrote. For Tertitskiy, there is little value in pressuring Moscow and even less attempting to apply pressure on North Korea. It would be smart for the US to turn its focus to Beijing if it does not want to see North Korean weapons used on Ukrainian battlefields. The Kremlin views North Korea as firmly within China’s orbit and ”very rarely” would Moscow pursue a course of action that was not in lockstep with Beijing views. While North Korea might like to diversify from China’s outsized influence over its economy, Russia cannot afford to ignore Beijing’s position when it comes to something as controversial as a potential trade in munitions for military technology between Moscow and Pyongyang. And if a deal is done, Washington should know that, tacitly, it had the blessing of Beijing, Tertitskiy said. “My advice to President Biden or to [Secretary of State] Antony Blinken or to anyone, I would say, ‘Send your ambassador to the Chinese’,” Tertitskiy said. “China is the only power which can really stop them. Because, if they [China] say to Putin, ‘We are displeased at this, this is our sphere of influence, do not trade with these guys’, Putin will probably follow because he can’t afford angering the Chinese”.

       "  'Text': 'Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he has requested that the European Commission extend the ban. Poland’s government has called on the European Union to extend the embargo on imports of Ukrainian grain beyond an end-of-week deadline to protect Polish farmers. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Tuesday he has requested that the European Commission, the EU’s executive, extend the ban on the entry of Ukraine corn, wheat, sunflower and rapeseed or else “we will do it ourselves because we cannot allow for a deregulation of the market.” Speaking to farmers in Kosow Lacki, in Poland’s farming east region, Morawiecki said that the October 15 parliamentary elections will be key for the future of Poland’s agriculture. The governing conservative Law and Justice party is seeking to attract farmer voters in its campaign. Earlier on Tuesday, Morawiecki said on X, formally known as Twitter, “Poland will not allow Ukraine grain to flood us.” “Regardless of the decisions of the clerks in Brussels, we will not open up our borders,” he added. The European Parliament is also set to debate the topic. Ukraine’s neighbours, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Romania, agreed with the European Union to impose an embargo on grain produced from Kyiv from April until September 15 to prevent a knock-on effect on its farmers. Only sealed goods are allowed to help Ukraine send its produce overseas as Russia blocks its usual export routes during the war. On Tuesday, EU Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski said he was trying to extend the embargo. Wojciechowski is Poland’s former agriculture minister. Some leaders of Polish farm groups were to attend the EU Parliament debate, including Michal Kolodziejczak, an opposition candidate running in the October elections. Poland has been supporting neighbouring Ukraine with military and humanitarian assistance as it fights Russia’s invasion, but following farmer protests, Warsaw has been adamant in banning imports of Ukrainian agriculture products. “We are ready to support Ukraine during the war and during its reconstruction and we want to take part in the reconstruction but at the same time, we must remember about our citizens, our agriculture and our countryside,” Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the ruling party leader and deputy prime minister, said at the start of the Cabinet meeting. “Our Ukrainian friends should understand that,” he said. But Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said on Tuesday that Kyiv was considering legal action about the ban. “We have no intention of harming Polish farmers … but in case of violation of trade law in the interest of political populism before the elections, Ukraine will be forced to turn to WTO arbitration to obtain compensation for violation of GATT norms,” he said on social media, referring to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

       "  'Text': 'Trump, the frontrunner Republican candidate for the 2024 US presidential elections, is facing a series of criminal cases by US authorities. Russian President Vladimir Putin says the cases against former US President Donald Trump are political revenge that shows the fundamental corruption of American politics. Trump, the frontrunner Republican candidate for the 2024 United States presidential elections, is facing a series of criminal cases. He is charged with, among other things, trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat to President Joe Biden. Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum gathering in Russia’s Vladivostok on Tuesday, Putin said: “As for Trump, for us what is happening in today’s conditions, in my opinion, is good because it shows the rottenness of the American political system, which cannot pretend to teach others democracy. “Everything that is happening with Trump is the persecution of a political rival for political reasons. That’s what it is. And this is being done in front of the public of the United States and the whole world.” During his four years in office, Trump repeatedly praised his good relations with Putin and claimed more recently he could resolve the Ukraine war in a matter of days if he regains the presidency. “We hear Mr Trump say he will solve pressing problems in a few days, including the Ukrainian crisis. Well, this cannot but bring happiness. This is good,” Putin said. But he said the idea Trump had special ties with Russia was “complete nonsense”. However, Putin reiterated that Russia’s relations with the US are unlikely to change regardless of who leads the country. “What to expect from the future, no matter who the president is, it’s hard for us to say, but it’s unlikely that anything will change radically,” Putin said. He claimed the Biden administration has a strong bias against Russia and “it will be very difficult for them to somehow turn this whole ship” in the other direction. Relations between Moscow and Washington, already strained during Trump’s presidency, have plunged to post-Cold War lows under Biden following Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine in February 2022. Putin, who served in the Soviet security services, said the legal efforts against Trump “show who we are fighting … As they said in Soviet times, ‘the bestial face of American imperialism’.” Putin added Western efforts to “restrain” China’s ascent as a global power were doomed to fail as he hailed Moscow’s “amazing” relations with Beijing. “Today the West is trying to restrain the development of China because it sees that China, under the leadership of our friend [President Xi Jinping] … is developing by leaps and bounds. This leaves them shocked,” said Russia’s leader. “They are doing everything to slow down the development of China, but this will not be possible. They are too late. That’s it, the train has left.” In separate comments, Putin said the West’s decision to supply Ukraine with cluster bombs and depleted uranium munitions was a crime, and while such supplies might prolong the war, they would not change its outcome.

       "  'Text': 'Ukrainian military intelligence says offshore platforms in Black Sea retaken by Kyiv forces in ‘unique operation’. The Ukrainian military said it has recaptured several strategic gas and oil drilling platforms from Russia in the Black Sea close to Crimea, which Moscow’s forces had occupied since 2015. The recapture of the so-called Boyko Towers platforms, which was reported on Monday, takes back an asset that Russia seized during the annexation of Crimea and places Kyiv closer to retaking the occupied peninsula, according to Ukrainian military intelligence (GUR). The GUR said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukrainian forces had retaken the drilling platforms in a “unique operation”. “For Ukraine, regaining control of the Boyko Towers was of strategic importance and, as a result, Russia lost the ability to use them for military purposes,” the GUR said on Telegram. “Russia has been deprived of the ability to fully control the waters of the Black Sea, and this makes Ukraine many steps closer to regaining Crimea,” the agency added. During the operation, there was a clash between Ukrainian special forces on boats and a Russian fighter jet, which was damaged and forced to retreat, the GUR said, adding that “valuable trophies” such as helicopter munitions and a radar system that can track the movement of ships in the Black Sea were seized at the platforms. The Russian defence ministry did not make any immediate comment on the Ukrainian claim, but the ministry has previously reported that Russian warplanes destroyed several Ukrainian speedboats in the area in recent days. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, said early on Tuesday that regaining control of the Boyko Towers was important as the structures were used by Russian forces for “all sorts of monitoring, control, and surveillance sensors, expanding the Russian operational capabilities” in the Black Sea.

This step was crucial not only in Ukraine’s struggle for the Black Sea but also for more space for its coastal and air operations,” he wrote. Russian military bloggers claimed on Monday that the platforms had been uninhabited for more than a year and that a Ukrainian operation to briefly land troops on the structures last month was not followed by a permanent military presence and came at a heavy cost to Ukraine’s forces.      Before Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula, Ukraine extracted a significant part of its natural gas from the Black Sea shelf, providing gas not only for Crimea but also to mainland regions of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has promised to do all he can to liberate Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The Ukrainian leader has urged international allies to support Kyiv’s efforts to retake the peninsula. The retaking of the Black Sea gas and oil platforms follows a report by the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence noting naval and air force skirmishes between Russian and Ukrainian forces at sea two weeks ago. Ukraine has struck several Russian-controlled platforms in fighting during the war and soldiers from both countries have occupied the structures periodically, the UK said in a military update on the war. Along with drilling, the platforms can be used to land helicopters, as deployment bases and to position long-range missile systems.               Follow Al Jazeera English:'},\n",

       "  'Date': '12 Sep 2023',\n",
       "  'Text': 'With the Russian leader in need of weapons for the war in Ukraine, Kim Jong Un is expected to extract a high price. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin held their first-ever summit in 2019. Kim travelled to Vladivostok in his armoured train where the men spent two days enjoying folk dances, feasting on borscht and reindeer dumplings, and toasting the burgeoning relationship between their two countries. At that time, broadly supportive of the United Nations sanctions imposed on Pyongyang over its weapons programme, Putin promised to do what he could with China and the United States to break the impasse in denuclearisation talks. Four years later, Kim and Putin are due to meet again. This time, however, it is all about arms sales and technology transfer. “It’s a new and terrifying world we are entering,” In-bum Chun, a retired Lieutenant General in the South Korean army and an expert on North Korea’s military and politics, told Al Jazeera. “Putin will receive weapons and North Korea, [the] technology to improve its nuclear weapons’ capabilities.” A big reason for the change is Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Moscow had hoped for a swift end to the conflict but the fighting has dragged on for more than 18 months. And Russia is now not only far more isolated on the world stage than it was in 2019, but also the target of sanctions. “This is a war of attrition,” said Mason Richey, an associate professor of international politics at Hankuk University for Foreign Studies in the South Korean capital Seoul. “We think of this as a war of people but that’s where Russia has a relative advantage. Where Ukraine has an advantage is in ‘metal’ – the military assets. It can count on support from the US and Europe. They’ve gone chips all in on supporting Ukraine.” According to the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank, Russia used some 12 million shells in Ukraine in 2022 and is expected to use some 7 million this year. Its munitions factories have the capacity to produce just 2.5 million shells a year. Given sanctions imposed on Moscow and the consequences of breaching them, “Russia’s search for ammunition partners has turned up a hodgepodge of aggrieved, ambitious and opportunistic nations,” Matthew Sussex, an expert in Russian foreign policy at the Australian National University, wrote in The Conversation on September 10. While North Korea has spent much of the recent past testing out the new weapons and military equipment it is developing to modernise its military, the country still has plenty of “metal” – from shells to ammunition – and the ability to produce it in large quantities. Bruce Bechtol, a professor in politics at Angelo State University in the US who has published books on the North Korean regime and its military proliferation, says Kim would probably be able to offer Russia 152mm artillery guns and different kinds of multiple rocket launchers, as well as small arms such as the Type 73 light machine gun, AK-47 assault rifle and the ammunition necessary for such systems. “There is no doubt that North Korea is very good at producing Soviet-designed systems of older design and turning them out rather quickly,” Bechtol told Al Jazeera. Chun agrees Pyongyang has a “full range of conventional weapons” on offer as well as drones, portable shoulder-fired missiles (MANPADS), and “a very capable anti-tank system called the Bulsae, which is similar to the Russian Kornet”. North Korea could even send soldiers, he added. And while the US, which first indicated last year that North Korea was prepared to send arms to Russia, has said Russia’s purchase of such weapons is a sign of desperation, analysts are not so sure. “North Korean weapons are reliable and inexpensive,” Chun said. “North Korea is also willing to sell. Why wouldn’t the Russians buy from them.”      Moscow and Pyongyang have maintained close ties since Soviet times – hence the older and compatible military hardware – but have moved closer since the start of the Ukraine invasion. But analysts point out that while Pyongyang once saw the Moscow relationship as largely transactional – useful for its leverage on China, its main ally – that is now changing. North Korea has emerged as one of the few emphatic supporters of the Russian invasion. It backed Moscow at the UN in March 2022, weeks after the invasion, and a few months later recognised the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic in partly-occupied eastern Ukraine as independent states. Moscow has also appeared to be more supportive of North Korea in the UN, preventing any action on Pyongyang’s missile tests despite serial sanctions violations. In July, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu visited Pyongyang. The guest of honour at the Victory Day celebrations in Pyongyang, Shoigu was the first Russian defence minister to visit the country since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Shoigu stood next to Kim to watch the military parade through Kim Il Sung Square, the North Korean leader was also pictured showing Shoigu around a defence exhibition showcasing North Korea’s latest weaponry, including banned ballistic missiles. Writing to Putin in August, when Pyongyang commemorates the end of Japanese colonialism in the Korean Peninsula, Kim said Russia and North Korea’s friendship had been forged with the victory over Japan in World War II, and called for the further development of a “a long-standing strategic partnership … with the demand(s) of the new era”. Putin told Kim, meanwhile, that he expected the two countries would “strengthen bilateral cooperation in all fields”. The question for many is the price that Russia, a permanent veto-holding member of the Security Council, would be willing to pay for the weaponry. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the problems facing the North Korean economy but as he sits down with Putin, Kim’s focus is likely to be on the military and his ongoing plan to develop new weapons and equipment. “It’s Kim’s best chance in a long time to get some assistance from the Russians,” Robert Kelly told Al Jazeera. “Putin’s in a tight spot. He needs this stuff.” North Korea, which the UN has accused of letting its people suffer while it develops its military might, will probably demand food or energy aid in exchange for the arms. But most analysts expect Kim to push Putin to share key military technology, including for Russia’s nuclear-powered submarines. Some already suspect Russian involvement – whether through technical assistance or proliferation – in recent North Korean weapons. Bechtol points to the new weapons’ similarities with Russia’s Iskander missile and its newfound capabilities in hypersonic missile technology. “All in all, Russia may be the biggest enabler of North Korea today, even more so than China,” wrote Victor Cha and Ellen Kim of the Washington, DC-based think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a commentary on September 6. “The latter has not been supportive of the denuclearization agenda and has not helped to bring Pyongyang back to the negotiating table, given the state of U.S.-China relations. But Beijing reportedly has been opposed to North Korea conducting a seventh nuclear test. This stands in contrast to potential arms and missile deals being negotiated by Moscow that could accelerate North Korea’s military satellite, nuclear submarine and ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) programs.” The US said last week that North Korea would “pay a price” for selling arms to Moscow but with Pyongyang sanctioned to the hilt, it seems there are few real options for Washington to increase pressure on Pyongyang. Kim, meanwhile, will be looking at his wish list of weaponry and hoping his friends in Moscow will provide him with the assistance he needs to ensure his military dreams move closer to reality. The security ramifications of the two men’s latest meeting in Vladivostok are likely to be felt far beyond Ukraine.          Follow Al Jazeera English:'}]"
